        somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

      &lt;p&gt;
        It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
        poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
        and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
        whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
        Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
        higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
        extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
        ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
        extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
        bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
        and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
        own.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
        belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world
        will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;
        but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
        and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
        and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness&amp;mdash;Give
        it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
        world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
        could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
        your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
        friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
        and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
        against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together&amp;mdash;there,
        ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!

        great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
        former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,

        which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was

        &amp;ldquo;Pedestrians in the vicinity of London and elsewhere may recollect
        having seen large curved bones set upright in the earth, either to form

      CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&amp;mdash;never mind how long precisely&amp;mdash;having
      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
      circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
      it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
      involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
      people&amp;rsquo;s hats off&amp;mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
      as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
      towards the ocean with me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
      as Indian isles by coral reefs&amp;mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.
      Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
      the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
      breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
      crowds of water-gazers there.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
      you see?&amp;mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
      over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as
      if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
      landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&amp;mdash;tied to counters,
      nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green
      fields gone? What do they here?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
      they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand&amp;mdash;miles of
      them&amp;mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
      streets and avenues&amp;mdash;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all
      unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
      of all those ships attract them thither?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
      and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let
      the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&amp;mdash;stand
      that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead
      you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be
      athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
      happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one
      knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
      quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
      the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
      each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
      here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
      cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,
      reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
      But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes
      down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&amp;rsquo;s head, yet all were vain,
      unless the shepherd&amp;rsquo;s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go
      visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
      knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&amp;mdash;what is the one charm wanting?&amp;mdash;Water&amp;mdash;there
      is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would
      you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
      Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
      whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a
      pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy
      with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to
      sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such
      a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
      of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the
      Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this
      is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
      Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he
      saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,
      we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
      ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to
      grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do
      not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to
      go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag
      unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&amp;mdash;grow
      quarrelsome&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t sleep of nights&amp;mdash;do not enjoy themselves
      much, as a general thing;&amp;mdash;no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though
      I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
      Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to
      those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable
      toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as
      much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,
      barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,&amp;mdash;though
      I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of
      officer on ship-board&amp;mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&amp;mdash;though
      once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,
      there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say
      reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous
      dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse,
      that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the
      pyramids.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
      plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,
      they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like
      a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is
      unpleasant enough. It touches one&amp;rsquo;s sense of honor, particularly if you
      come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or
      Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting
      your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country
      schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition
      is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires
      a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear
      it. But even this wears off in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
      mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
      Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
      respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&amp;rsquo;t a
      slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me
      about&amp;mdash;however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
      satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one
      way or other served in much the same way&amp;mdash;either in a physical or
      metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed
      round, and all hands should rub each other&amp;rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be
      content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying
      me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I
      ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there
      is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act
      of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two
      orchard thieves entailed upon us. But &lt;i&gt;being paid&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;mdash;what will compare
      with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
      marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root
      of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
      Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise
      and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are
      far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate
      the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the
      quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the
      forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
      way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same
      time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
      having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it
      into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
      of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs
      me, and influences me in some unaccountable way&amp;mdash;he can better answer
      than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed
      part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time
      ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
      extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
      something like this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.&lt;/i&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. &amp;ldquo;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
      Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
      were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy
      parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces&amp;mdash;though I cannot
      tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I
      think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being
      cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about
      performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it
      was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating
      judgment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
      himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
      Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the
      undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending
      marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to
      my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been
      inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for
      things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous
      coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and
      could still be social with it&amp;mdash;would they let me&amp;mdash;since it is
      but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one
      lodges in.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
      flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
      swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
      endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand
      hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
      and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old
      Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in
      December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for
      Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would
      offer, till the following Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
      this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be
      related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up
      to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine,
      boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old
      island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late
      been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this
      matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her
      great original&amp;mdash;the Tyre of this Carthage;&amp;mdash;the place where the
      first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did
      those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give
      chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
      adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
      cobblestones&amp;mdash;so goes the story&amp;mdash;to throw at the whales, in
      order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
      bowsprit?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in
      New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter
      of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very
      dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and
      cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded
      my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&amp;mdash;So, wherever
      you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary
      street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
      the darkness towards the south&amp;mdash;wherever in your wisdom you may
      conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the
      price, and don&amp;rsquo;t be too particular.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of &amp;ldquo;The
      Crossed Harpoons&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
      Further on, from the bright red windows of the &amp;ldquo;Sword-Fish Inn,&amp;rdquo; there
      came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
      ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten
      inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,&amp;mdash;rather weary for me,
      when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,
      remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.
      Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the
      broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
      within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&amp;rsquo;t you hear? get away from
      before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I
      now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,
      doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and
      here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this
      hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town
      proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding
      from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had
      a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so,
      entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the
      porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are
      these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But &amp;ldquo;The Crossed
      Harpoons,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Sword-Fish?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;this, then must needs be the sign
      of &amp;ldquo;The Trap.&amp;rdquo; However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
      within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
      faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
      Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
      preacher&amp;rsquo;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
      wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
      Wretched entertainment at the sign of &amp;lsquo;The Trap!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
      and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging
      sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a
      tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;The
      Spouter Inn:&amp;mdash;Peter Coffin.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Coffin?&amp;mdash;Spouter?&amp;mdash;Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
      thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose
      this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
      the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little
      wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the
      ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
      poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
      spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a queer sort of place&amp;mdash;a gable-ended old house, one side
      palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak
      corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling
      than ever it did about poor Paul&amp;rsquo;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
      is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob
      quietly toasting for bed. &amp;ldquo;In judging of that tempestuous wind called
      Euroclydon,&amp;rdquo; says an old writer&amp;mdash;of whose works I possess the only
      copy extant&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest
      out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or
      whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on
      both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&amp;rdquo; True
      enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind&amp;mdash;old
      black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this
      body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn&amp;rsquo;t stop up the chinks and
      the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&amp;rsquo;s
      too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the
      copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor
      Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,
      and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both
      ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not
      keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his
      red silken wrapper&amp;mdash;(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What
      a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them
      talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give
      me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to
      the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than
      here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of
      the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to
      keep out this frost?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
      door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
      moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar
      in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
      temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
      plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,
      and see what sort of a place this &amp;ldquo;Spouter&amp;rdquo; may be.

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,
      straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the
      bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
      oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
      unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study
      and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the
      neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
      purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of
      much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
      might not be altogether unwarranted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
      black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
      blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,
      soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
      Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity
      about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath
      with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and
      anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s
      the Black Sea in a midnight gale.&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s the unnatural combat of the
      four primal elements.&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s a blasted heath.&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s a Hyperborean
      winter scene.&amp;mdash;It&amp;rsquo;s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.
      But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
      the picture&amp;rsquo;s midst. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; once found out, and all the rest were plain. But
      stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the
      great leviathan himself?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In fact, the artist&amp;rsquo;s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly
      based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I
      conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
      great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
      dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
      spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
      upon the three mast-heads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array
      of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth
      resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and
      one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment
      made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you
      gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have
      gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed
      with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and
      deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly
      elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
      sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon&amp;mdash;so like a corkscrew now&amp;mdash;was
      flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain
      off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like
      a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty
      feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way&amp;mdash;cut
      through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
      fireplaces all round&amp;mdash;you enter the public room. A still duskier
      place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
      planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft&amp;rsquo;s
      cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
      old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
      table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
      gathered from this wide world&amp;rsquo;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
      further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den&amp;mdash;the bar&amp;mdash;a
      rude attempt at a right whale&amp;rsquo;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
      vast arched bone of the whale&amp;rsquo;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
      beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
      bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another
      cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little
      withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
      and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
      cylinders without&amp;mdash;within, the villanous green goggling glasses
      deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
      rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads&amp;rsquo; goblets. Fill to
      &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; mark, and your charge is but a penny; to &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; a penny more; and so on
      to the full glass&amp;mdash;the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for
      a shilling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a
      table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of &lt;i&gt;skrimshander&lt;/i&gt;. I sought
      the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,
      received for answer that his house was full&amp;mdash;not a bed unoccupied.
      &amp;ldquo;But avast,&amp;rdquo; he added, tapping his forehead, &amp;ldquo;you haint no objections to
      sharing a harpooneer&amp;rsquo;s blanket, have ye? I s&amp;rsquo;pose you are goin&amp;rsquo; a-whalin&amp;rsquo;,
      so you&amp;rsquo;d better get used to that sort of thing.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever
      do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he
      (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was
      not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a
      strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any
      decent man&amp;rsquo;s blanket.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?&amp;mdash;you want supper?
      Supper&amp;rsquo;ll be ready directly.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
      Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
      his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
      between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he
      didn&amp;rsquo;t make much headway, I thought.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining
      room. It was cold as Iceland&amp;mdash;no fire at all&amp;mdash;the landlord said
      he couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
      winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to
      our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare
      was of the most substantial kind&amp;mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but
      dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green
      box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;My boy,&amp;rdquo; said the landlord, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll have the nightmare to a dead
      sartainty.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord,&amp;rdquo; I whispered, &amp;ldquo;that aint the harpooneer is it?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, no,&amp;rdquo; said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, &amp;ldquo;the harpooneer
      is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;he
      eats nothing but steaks, and he likes &amp;rsquo;em rare.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The devil he does,&amp;rdquo; says I. &amp;ldquo;Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;ll be here afore long,&amp;rdquo; was the answer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this &amp;ldquo;dark
      complexioned&amp;rdquo; harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
      turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed
      before I did.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what
      else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
      looker on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
      cried, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the Grampus&amp;rsquo;s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this
      morning; a three years&amp;rsquo; voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we&amp;rsquo;ll
      have the latest news from the Feegees.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
      and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy
      watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
      bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
      eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and
      this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a
      straight wake for the whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth&amp;mdash;the bar&amp;mdash;when the wrinkled
      little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
      round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed
      him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
      sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
      long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
      weather side of an ice-island.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with
      the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about
      most obstreperously.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
      seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
      sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as
      the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had
      ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a
      sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here
      venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in
      height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom
      seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his
      white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his
      eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
      His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine
      stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
      Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had
      mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more
      of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he
      was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge
      favourite with them, they raised a cry of &amp;ldquo;Bulkington! Bulkington! where&amp;rsquo;s
      Bulkington?&amp;rdquo; and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was now about nine o&amp;rsquo;clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
      quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little
      plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
      rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it is, but people
      like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping
      with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that
      stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was
      there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more
      than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than
      bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one
      apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own
      blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
      thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
      harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
      the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
      Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
      and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight&amp;mdash;how
      could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord! I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.&amp;mdash;I shan&amp;rsquo;t
      sleep with him. I&amp;rsquo;ll try the bench here.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Just as you please; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I can&amp;rsquo;t spare ye a tablecloth for a
      mattress, and it&amp;rsquo;s a plaguy rough board here&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;feeling of the knots
      and notches. &amp;ldquo;But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&amp;rsquo;ve got a carpenter&amp;rsquo;s plane
      there in the bar&amp;mdash;wait, I say, and I&amp;rsquo;ll make ye snug enough.&amp;rdquo; So
      saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first
      dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while
      grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
      plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near
      spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake to quit&amp;mdash;the
      bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in
      the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
      shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the
      middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown
      study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
      short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
      narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than
      the planed one&amp;mdash;so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first
      bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a
      little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found
      that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of
      the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another
      current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both
      together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of
      the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&amp;rsquo;t I steal a
      march on him&amp;mdash;bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
      wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
      second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
      morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
      standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a
      sufferable night unless in some other person&amp;rsquo;s bed, I began to think that
      after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this
      unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in
      before long. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become
      jolly good bedfellows after all&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s no telling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
      and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord!&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;what sort of a chap is he&amp;mdash;does he always keep
      such late hours?&amp;rdquo; It was now hard upon twelve o&amp;rsquo;clock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
      mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; he answered,
      &amp;ldquo;generally he&amp;rsquo;s an early bird&amp;mdash;airley to bed and airley to rise&amp;mdash;yes,
      he&amp;rsquo;s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,
      you see, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be,
      he can&amp;rsquo;t sell his head.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t sell his head?&amp;mdash;What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
      are telling me?&amp;rdquo; getting into a towering rage. &amp;ldquo;Do you pretend to say,
      landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
      night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s precisely it,&amp;rdquo; said the landlord, &amp;ldquo;and I told him he couldn&amp;rsquo;t sell
      it here, the market&amp;rsquo;s overstocked.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;With what?&amp;rdquo; shouted I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;With heads to be sure; ain&amp;rsquo;t there too many heads in the world?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I tell you what it is, landlord,&amp;rdquo; said I quite calmly, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;d better stop
      spinning that yarn to me&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m not green.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;May be not,&amp;rdquo; taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, &amp;ldquo;but I rayther
      guess you&amp;rsquo;ll be done &lt;i&gt;brown&lt;/i&gt; if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&amp;rsquo; 
      his head.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll break it for him,&amp;rdquo; said I, now flying into a passion again at this
      unaccountable farrago of the landlord&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s broke a&amp;rsquo;ready,&amp;rdquo; said he.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Broke,&amp;rdquo; said I&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;broke&lt;/i&gt;, do you mean?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sartain, and that&amp;rsquo;s the very reason he can&amp;rsquo;t sell it, I guess.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord,&amp;rdquo; said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;landlord,
      stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too
      without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can
      only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain
      harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you
      persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending
      to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design
      for my bedfellow&amp;mdash;a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate
      and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak
      out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in
      all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you
      will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if
      true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and
      I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; I mean,
      landlord, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
      thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wall,&amp;rdquo; said the landlord, fetching a long breath, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s a purty long
      sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
      this here harpooneer I have been tellin&amp;rsquo; you of has just arrived from the
      south seas, where he bought up a lot of &amp;rsquo;balmed New Zealand heads (great
      curios, you know), and he&amp;rsquo;s sold all on &amp;rsquo;em but one, and that one he&amp;rsquo;s
      trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow&amp;rsquo;s Sunday, and it would not do to
      be sellin&amp;rsquo; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&amp;rsquo; to churches.
      He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin&amp;rsquo; out of
      the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a
      string of inions.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
      that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me&amp;mdash;but at
      the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
      Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
      business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He pays reg&amp;rsquo;lar,&amp;rdquo; was the rejoinder. &amp;ldquo;But come, it&amp;rsquo;s getting dreadful
      late, you had better be turning flukes&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s a nice bed; Sal and me
      slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room
      for two to kick about in that bed; it&amp;rsquo;s an almighty big bed that. Why,
      afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot
      of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,
      Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that,
      Sal said it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do. Come along here, I&amp;rsquo;ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;&amp;rdquo;
       and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead
      the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he
      exclaimed &amp;ldquo;I vum it&amp;rsquo;s Sunday&amp;mdash;you won&amp;rsquo;t see that harpooneer to-night;
      he&amp;rsquo;s come to anchor somewhere&amp;mdash;come along then; &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; come; &lt;i&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; ye
      come?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
      ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
      with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
      to sleep abreast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There,&amp;rdquo; said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
      that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; &amp;ldquo;there, make
      yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.&amp;rdquo; I turned round from
      eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
      most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced
      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no
      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,
      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not
      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown
      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman&amp;rsquo;s bag, containing the
      harpooneer&amp;rsquo;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there
      was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
      fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
      at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing
      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags
      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in
      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer
      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in
      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a
      hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as
      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I
      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw
      such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I
      gave myself a kink in the neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
      head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half
      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the
      harpooneer&amp;rsquo;s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I
      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then
      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care
      of heaven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there
      is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a
      long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly
      made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall
      in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under
      the door.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
      head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of
      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness
      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
      unlacing the bag&amp;rsquo;s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round&amp;mdash;when,
      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,
      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking
      squares. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s just as I thought, he&amp;rsquo;s a terrible bedfellow; he&amp;rsquo;s been
      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But
      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I
      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred
      to me. I remembered a story of a white man&amp;mdash;a whaleman too&amp;mdash;who,
      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that
      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with
      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&amp;rsquo;s only his
      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make
      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,
      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it
      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of
      a hot sun&amp;rsquo;s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the
      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head&amp;mdash;a ghastly
      thing enough&amp;mdash;and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
      hat&amp;mdash;a new beaver hat&amp;mdash;when I came nigh singing out with fresh
      surprise. There was no hair on his head&amp;mdash;none to speak of at least&amp;mdash;nothing
      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head
      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than
      ever I bolted a dinner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it
      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance
      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded
      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was
      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to
      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed
      inexplicable in him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his
      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with
      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark
      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&amp;rsquo; War, and just escaped
      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were
      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of
      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage
      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in
      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too&amp;mdash;perhaps
      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine&amp;mdash;heavens!
      look at that tomahawk!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a
      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days&amp;rsquo; old Congo baby.
      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black
      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that
      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished
      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed
      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and
      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,
      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks
      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill
      at ease meantime&amp;mdash;to see what was next to follow. First he takes
      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top
      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a
      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and
      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be
      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;
      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it
      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry
      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics
      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who
      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or
      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,
      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a
      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him
      now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and
      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before
      the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been
      bound.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an
      instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was
      extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang
      into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden
      grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against
      the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep
      quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural
      responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who-e debel you?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he at last said&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;you no speak-e, dam-me, I
      kill-e.&amp;rdquo; And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in
      the dark.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake, Peter Coffin!&amp;rdquo; shouted I. &amp;ldquo;Landlord! Watch!
      Coffin! Angels! save me!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!&amp;rdquo; again growled the
      cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot
      tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But
      thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in
      hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid now,&amp;rdquo; said he, grinning again, &amp;ldquo;Queequeg here wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
      harm a hair of your head.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stop your grinning,&amp;rdquo; shouted I, &amp;ldquo;and why didn&amp;rsquo;t you tell me that that
      infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I thought ye know&amp;rsquo;d it;&amp;mdash;didn&amp;rsquo;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&amp;rsquo; heads
      around town?&amp;mdash;but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
      here&amp;mdash;you sabbee me, I sabbee&amp;mdash;you this man sleepe you&amp;mdash;you
      sabbee?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Me sabbee plenty&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
      sitting up in bed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;You gettee in,&amp;rdquo; he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing
      the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a
      really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all
      his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
      What&amp;rsquo;s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself&amp;mdash;the
      man&amp;rsquo;s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,
      as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a
      drunken Christian.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Landlord,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
      whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn
      in with him. But I don&amp;rsquo;t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It&amp;rsquo;s
      dangerous. Besides, I ain&amp;rsquo;t insured.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
      motioned me to get into bed&amp;mdash;rolling over to one side as much as to
      say&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t touch a leg of ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good night, landlord,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;you may go.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s arm thrown
      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought
      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little
      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all
      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of
      which were of one precise shade&amp;mdash;owing I suppose to his keeping his
      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly
      rolled up at various times&amp;mdash;this same arm of his, I say, looked for
      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly
      lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from
      the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
      sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging
      me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other&amp;mdash;I
      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep
      do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all
      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,&amp;mdash;my mother
      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though
      it was only two o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day
      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help
      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,
      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a
      bitter sigh got between the sheets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of
      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in
      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the
      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse&amp;mdash;at
      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,
      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,
      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my
      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an
      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of
      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay
      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,
      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen
      into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it&amp;mdash;half
      steeped in dreams&amp;mdash;I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was
      now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through
      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,
      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand
      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled
      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag
      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single
      inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness
      at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly
      remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost
      myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very
      hour, I often puzzle myself with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s pagan arm
      thrown round me. But at length all the past night&amp;rsquo;s events soberly
      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the
      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm&amp;mdash;unlock his
      bridegroom clasp&amp;mdash;yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me
      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to
      rouse him&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Queequeg!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but his only answer was a snore. I then
      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly
      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the
      tomahawk sleeping by the savage&amp;rsquo;s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced
      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in
      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! &amp;ldquo;Queequeg!&amp;mdash;in the
      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!&amp;rdquo; At length, by dint of much wriggling,
      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all
      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff
      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of
      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I
      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon
      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed
      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it
      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain
      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would
      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is
      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate
      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially
      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he
      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of
      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette
      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don&amp;rsquo;t see every day, he and his ways
      were well worth unusual regarding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
      by the by, and then&amp;mdash;still minus his trowsers&amp;mdash;he hunted up his
      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
      movement was to crush himself&amp;mdash;boots in hand, and hat on&amp;mdash;under
      the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage&amp;mdash;neither
      caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his
      outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not
      yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree
      civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at
      all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have
      dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with
      his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
      creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to
      boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones&amp;mdash;probably not made to
      order either&amp;mdash;rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of
      a bitter cold morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into
      the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg
      made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged
      him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied,
      and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any
      Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement,
      contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and
      hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on
      the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering
      his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and
      behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long
      wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
      striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
      scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is
      using Rogers&amp;rsquo;s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the
      less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of
      a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are
      always kept.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
      harpoon like a marshal&amp;rsquo;s baton.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
      grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
      though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
      bedfellow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good
      thing; the more&amp;rsquo;s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,
      afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let
      him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the
      man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is
      more in that man than you perhaps think for.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
      night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
      nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
      sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and
      ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,
      shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
      young fellow&amp;rsquo;s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would
      seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from
      his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might
      say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still
      lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; doubtless has
      tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?
      which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes&amp;rsquo; western slope, to
      show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Grub, ho!&amp;rdquo; now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went
      to breakfast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in
      manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the
      great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men,
      they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere
      crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the
      taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of
      Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo&amp;rsquo;s performances&amp;mdash;this kind of
      travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
      polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
      anywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after
      we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good
      stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
      maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
      embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
      slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas&amp;mdash;entire
      strangers to them&amp;mdash;and duelled them dead without winking; and yet,
      here they sat at a social breakfast table&amp;mdash;all of the same calling,
      all of kindred tastes&amp;mdash;looking round as sheepishly at each other as
      though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
      Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
      whalemen!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as for Queequeg&amp;mdash;why, Queequeg sat there among them&amp;mdash;at the
      head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
      cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
      cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and
      using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the
      imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
      But &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that
      in most people&amp;rsquo;s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We will not speak of all Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
      coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
      done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest
      into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there
      quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied
      out for a stroll.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 6. The Street.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an
      individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized
      town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll
      through the streets of New Bedford.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
      offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even
      in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes
      jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and
      Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared
      the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these
      last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual
      cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom
      yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
      and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
      which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
      more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
      scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and
      glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows
      who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the
      whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In
      some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that
      chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed
      coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with
      a sou&amp;rsquo;-wester and a bombazine cloak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one&amp;mdash;I mean a
      downright bumpkin dandy&amp;mdash;a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
      two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
      country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
      reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical
      things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he
      orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah,
      poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling
      gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of
      the tempest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
      bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
      place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day
      perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it
      is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so
      bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New
      England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land,
      also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the
      spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,
      nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and
      gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted
      upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
      mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses
      and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
      One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of
      the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
      daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You
      must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they
      have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn
      their lengths in spermaceti candles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples&amp;mdash;long
      avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and
      bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their
      tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;
      which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces
      of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation&amp;rsquo;s final
      day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
      roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is
      perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom
      of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls
      breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as
      though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the
      Puritanic sands.

      CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman&amp;rsquo;s Chapel, and few are the
      moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail
      to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
      special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
      sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
      bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a
      small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors&amp;rsquo; wives and widows. A
      muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.
      Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as
      if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not
      yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat
      steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned
      into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like
      the following, but I do not pretend to quote:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost
      overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, &lt;i&gt;November&lt;/i&gt; 1&lt;i&gt;st&lt;/i&gt;, 1836.
      THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER
      CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats&amp;rsquo; crews OF THE
      SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground
      in the PACIFIC, &lt;i&gt;December&lt;/i&gt; 31&lt;i&gt;st&lt;/i&gt;, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their
      surviving SHIPMATES.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of
      his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, &lt;i&gt;August&lt;/i&gt; 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;,
      1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself
      near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.
      Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of
      incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person
      present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who
      could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions
      on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names
      appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many
      are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several
      women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing
      grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
      unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused
      the old wounds to bleed afresh.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among
      flowers can say&amp;mdash;here, &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; lies my beloved; ye know not the
      desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those
      black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those
      immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the
      lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the
      beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might those
      tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why
      it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,
      though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to
      his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so
      significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but
      embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life
      Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal,
      unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam
      who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be
      comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in
      unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead;
      wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.
      All these things are not without their meanings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead
      doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
      Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light
      of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone
      before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew
      merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion,
      it seems&amp;mdash;aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes,
      there is death in this business of whaling&amp;mdash;a speechlessly quick
      chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have
      hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they
      call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in
      looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the
      sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
      Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body
      who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for
      Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave
      my soul, Jove himself cannot.

      CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was
      the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a
      very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,
      but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the
      time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy
      old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering
      youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain
      mild gleams of a newly developing bloom&amp;mdash;the spring verdure peeping
      forth even beneath February&amp;rsquo;s snow. No one having previously heard his
      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost
      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities
      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he
      entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come
      in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and
      his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with
      the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and
      overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an
      adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the
      pulpit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
      seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it
      seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit
      without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those
      used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain
      had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for
      this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a
      mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel
      it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the
      foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of
      the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
      steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
      swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
      so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the
      pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these
      joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared
      to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and
      stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,
      till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little
      Quebec.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
      that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of
      the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;
      furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by
      that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for
      the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for
      replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of
      God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold&amp;mdash;a lofty
      Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
      borrowed from the chaplain&amp;rsquo;s former sea-farings. Between the marble
      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was
      adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against
      a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But
      high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little
      isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&amp;rsquo;s face; and this bright
      face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship&amp;rsquo;s tossed deck,
      something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory&amp;rsquo;s plank
      where Nelson fell. &amp;ldquo;Ah, noble ship,&amp;rdquo; the angel seemed to say, &amp;ldquo;beat on,
      beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is
      breaking through; the clouds are rolling off&amp;mdash;serenest azure is at
      hand.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had
      achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
      likeness of a ship&amp;rsquo;s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting
      piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship&amp;rsquo;s fiddle-headed beak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What could be more full of meaning?&amp;mdash;for the pulpit is ever this
      earth&amp;rsquo;s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads
      the world. From thence it is the storm of God&amp;rsquo;s quick wrath is first
      descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the
      God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds. Yes,
      the world&amp;rsquo;s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the
      pulpit is its prow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
      the scattered people to condense. &amp;ldquo;Starboard gangway, there! side away to
      larboard&amp;mdash;larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still
      slighter shuffling of women&amp;rsquo;s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every
      eye on the preacher.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit&amp;rsquo;s bows, folded his large
      brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a
      prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom
      of the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
      bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog&amp;mdash;in such tones he
      commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the
      concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
     &amp;ldquo;The ribs and terrors in the whale,
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
     While all God&amp;rsquo;s sun-lit waves rolled by,
     And lift me deepening down to doom.

     &amp;ldquo;I saw the opening maw of hell,
     With endless pains and sorrows there;
     Which none but they that feel can tell&amp;mdash;
     Oh, I was plunging to despair.

     &amp;ldquo;In black distress, I called my God,
     When I could scarce believe him mine,
     He bowed his ear to my complaints&amp;mdash;
     No more the whale did me confine.

     &amp;ldquo;With speed he flew to my relief,
     As on a radiant dolphin borne;
     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
     The face of my Deliverer God.

     &amp;ldquo;My song for ever shall record
     That terrible, that joyful hour;
     I give the glory to my God,
     His all the mercy and the power.&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
      howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
      over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the
      proper page, said: &amp;ldquo;Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first
      chapter of Jonah&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
      Jonah.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters&amp;mdash;four yarns&amp;mdash;is
      one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet
      what depths of the soul does Jonah&amp;rsquo;s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the
      fish&amp;rsquo;s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods
      surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
      sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is this lesson
      that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a
      lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the
      living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story
      of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift
      punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of
      Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was
      in his wilful disobedience of the command of God&amp;mdash;never mind now what
      that command was, or how conveyed&amp;mdash;which he found a hard command. But
      all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do&amp;mdash;remember
      that&amp;mdash;and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
      And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
      disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,
      by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry
      him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this
      earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that&amp;rsquo;s bound
      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By
      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.
      That&amp;rsquo;s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is
      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed
      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast
      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two
      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of
      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee
      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of
      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;
      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the
      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been
      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,
      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he&amp;rsquo;s a fugitive! no
      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&amp;mdash;no friends accompany
      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he
      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&amp;rsquo;s evil eye.
      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in
      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the
      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,
      one whispers to the other&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Jack, he&amp;rsquo;s robbed a widow;&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;Joe, do
      you mark him; he&amp;rsquo;s a bigamist;&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;Harry lad, I guess he&amp;rsquo;s the adulterer
      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers
      from Sodom.&amp;rdquo; Another runs to read the bill that&amp;rsquo;s stuck against the spile
      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold
      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of
      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands
      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his
      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself
      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of
      it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,
      they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rsquo; cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out
      his papers for the Customs&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rsquo; Oh! how that harmless
      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But
      he rallies. &amp;lsquo;I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,
      sir?&amp;rsquo; Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man
      now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than
      he darts a scrutinizing glance. &amp;lsquo;We sail with the next coming tide,&amp;rsquo; at
      last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. &amp;lsquo;No sooner, sir?&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;Soon
      enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.&amp;rsquo; Ha! Jonah, that&amp;rsquo;s
      another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll
      sail with ye,&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;he says,&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;the passage money how much is that?&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll
      pay now.&amp;rsquo; For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing
      not to be overlooked in this history, &amp;lsquo;that he paid the fare thereof&amp;rsquo; ere
      the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now Jonah&amp;rsquo;s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
      in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this
      world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a
      passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So
      Jonah&amp;rsquo;s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah&amp;rsquo;s purse, ere he judge
      him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it&amp;rsquo;s assented to.
      Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time
      resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah
      fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.
      He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he
      mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. &amp;lsquo;Point out my state-room,
      Sir,&amp;rsquo; says Jonah now, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m travel-weary; I need sleep.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Thou lookest like
      it,&amp;rsquo; says the Captain, &amp;lsquo;there&amp;rsquo;s thy room.&amp;rsquo; Jonah enters, and would lock
      the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling
      there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about
      the doors of convicts&amp;rsquo; cells being never allowed to be locked within. All
      dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds
      the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath
      the ship&amp;rsquo;s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that
      stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his
      bowels&amp;rsquo; wards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates
      in Jonah&amp;rsquo;s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the
      weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in
      slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the
      room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious
      the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens
      Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and
      this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
      But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,
      the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &amp;lsquo;Oh! so my conscience hangs in
      me!&amp;rsquo; he groans, &amp;lsquo;straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
      soul are all in crookedness!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
      one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
      praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the
      whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who
      bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there&amp;rsquo;s naught to
      staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah&amp;rsquo;s prodigy of
      ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!
      the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked
      burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when
      the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars
      are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are
      yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah&amp;rsquo;s
      head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees
      no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little
      hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with
      open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
      down into the sides of the ship&amp;mdash;a berth in the cabin as I have taken
      it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and
      shrieks in his dead ear, &amp;lsquo;What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!&amp;rsquo; Startled
      from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and
      stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at
      that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the
      bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy
      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning
      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face
      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the
      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again
      towards the tormented deep.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
      attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
      him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
      fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,
      they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
      upon them. The lot is Jonah&amp;rsquo;s; that discovered, then how furiously they
      mob him with their questions. &amp;lsquo;What is thine occupation? Whence comest
      thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
      of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;
      whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise
      another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer
      is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I am a Hebrew,&amp;rsquo; he cries&amp;mdash;and then&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;I fear the Lord the God
      of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!&amp;rsquo; Fear him, O Jonah? Aye,
      well mightest thou fear the Lord God &lt;i&gt;then!&lt;/i&gt; Straightway, he now goes on to
      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
      appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God
      for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,&amp;mdash;when
      wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the
      sea, for he knew that for &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; sake this great tempest was upon them; they
      mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But
      all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised
      invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of
      Jonah.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when
      instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,
      as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He
      goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he
      scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws
      awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many
      white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the
      fish&amp;rsquo;s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For
      sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He
      feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance
      to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
      pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is
      true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
      punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in
      the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I
      do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him
      before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to
      repent of it like Jonah.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting
      storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when
      describing Jonah&amp;rsquo;s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep
      chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring
      elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy
      brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look
      on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
      of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
      eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
      with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon
      me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah
      teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I
      am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from
      this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as
      you listen, while some one of you reads &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; that other and more awful
      lesson which Jonah teaches to &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, as a pilot of the living God. How being
      an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the
      Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,
      Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,
      and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God
      is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon
      him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with
      swift slantings tore him along &amp;lsquo;into the midst of the seas,&amp;rsquo; where the
      eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and &amp;lsquo;the weeds were
      wrapped about his head,&amp;rsquo; and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
      Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;out of the belly of
      hell&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;when the whale grounded upon the ocean&amp;rsquo;s utmost bones, even
      then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God
      spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the
      sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and
      all the delights of air and earth; and &amp;lsquo;vomited out Jonah upon the dry
      land;&amp;rsquo; when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised
      and beaten&amp;mdash;his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously
      murmuring of the ocean&amp;mdash;Jonah did the Almighty&amp;rsquo;s bidding. And what
      was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That
      was it!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the
      living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel
      duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed
      them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe
      to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in
      this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even
      though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot
      Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face
      to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a
      heavenly enthusiasm,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
      every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
      than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the
      kelson is low? Delight is to him&amp;mdash;a far, far upward, and inward
      delight&amp;mdash;who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,
      ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
      arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
      gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
      truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from
      under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,&amp;mdash;top-gallant delight
      is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is
      only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
      billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure
      Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who
      coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath&amp;mdash;O Father!&amp;mdash;chiefly
      known to me by Thy rod&amp;mdash;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have
      striven to be Thine, more than to be this world&amp;rsquo;s, or mine own. Yet this
      is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live
      out the lifetime of his God?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
      his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and
      he was left alone in the place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite
      alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was
      sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and
      in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of
      his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling
      away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to
      the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began
      counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page&amp;mdash;as
      I fancied&amp;mdash;stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving
      utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then
      begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each
      time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by
      such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment
      at the multitude of pages was excited.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously
      marred about the face&amp;mdash;at least to my taste&amp;mdash;his countenance yet
      had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide
      the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces
      of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and
      bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.
      And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,
      which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man
      who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too,
      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I
      will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
      phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded
      me of General Washington&amp;rsquo;s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It
      had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows,
      which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly
      wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
      never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
      wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
      Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,
      and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me
      upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very
      strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly
      how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm
      self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed
      also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
      other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no
      desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as
      mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost
      sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the
      way of Cape Horn, that is&amp;mdash;which was the only way he could get there&amp;mdash;thrown
      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;
      and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;
      content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this
      was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there
      was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we
      mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I
      hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I
      conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have &amp;ldquo;broken his
      digester.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild
      stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only
      glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the
      casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm
      booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange
      feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened
      hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had
      redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in
      which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he
      was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself
      mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have
      repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I&amp;rsquo;ll
      try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but
      hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
      and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little
      noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last
      night&amp;rsquo;s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
      bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a
      little complimented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him
      the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were
      in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to
      jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in
      this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch
      and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging
      puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between
      us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan&amp;rsquo;s
      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left
      us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I
      to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine,
      clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married;
      meaning, in his country&amp;rsquo;s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would
      gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame
      of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much
      distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
      together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous
      tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty
      dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically
      dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and
      said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by
      pouring them into my trowsers&amp;rsquo; pockets. I let them stay. He then went
      about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper
      fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for
      me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a
      moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth&amp;mdash;pagans
      and all included&amp;mdash;can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of
      black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?&amp;mdash;to do the will of God&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;
      is worship. And what is the will of God?&amp;mdash;to do to my fellow man what
      I would have my fellow man to do to me&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the will of God. Now,
      Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do
      to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
      Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
      idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little
      idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or
      thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at
      peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to
      sleep without some little chat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
      disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very
      bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and
      chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts&amp;rsquo; 
      honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg&amp;mdash;a cosy, loving pair.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
      Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over
      mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy
      were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little
      nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting
      up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began
      to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up;
      the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our
      four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them,
      as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more
      so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too,
      seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because
      truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for
      there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by
      contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are
      all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be
      said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
      the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why
      then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and
      unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be
      furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the
      rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but
      the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.
      Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic
      crystal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by
      day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
      being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except
      his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our
      essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening
      my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness
      into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
      twelve-o&amp;rsquo;clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I
      at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
      strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a
      strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,
      that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
      the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love
      once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have
      Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such
      serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the
      landlord&amp;rsquo;s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed
      confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
      friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
      the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
      hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
      distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,
      eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly
      complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his
      words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with
      his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as
      it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.

      CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
      South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
      grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
      sapling; even then, in Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
      to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His
      father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the
      maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
      warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins&amp;mdash;royal stuff; though
      sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
      untutored youth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A Sag Harbor ship visited his father&amp;rsquo;s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage
      to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen,
      spurned his suit; and not all the King his father&amp;rsquo;s influence could
      prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a
      distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted
      the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of
      land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding
      his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he
      sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding
      by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of
      his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
      himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
      swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass
      over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged
      not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit
      Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make
      himself at home. But this fine young savage&amp;mdash;this sea Prince of
      Wales, never saw the Captain&amp;rsquo;s cabin. They put him down among the sailors,
      and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the
      shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if
      thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored
      countrymen. For at bottom&amp;mdash;so he told me&amp;mdash;he was actuated by a
      profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make
      his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better
      than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him
      that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
      so, than all his father&amp;rsquo;s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and
      seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and
      seeing how they spent their wages in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; place also, poor Queequeg gave
      it up for lost. Thought he, it&amp;rsquo;s a wicked world in all meridians; I&amp;rsquo;ll die
      a pagan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
      wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
      ways about him, though now some time from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a
      coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being
      very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and
      added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted
      him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings
      before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,&amp;mdash;as soon as he
      felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail
      about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a
      harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
      movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
      this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
      intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for
      an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany
      me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
      the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with
      both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all
      this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for
      Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to
      be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the
      mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to
      merchant seamen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      His story being ended with his pipe&amp;rsquo;s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced
      me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
      rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
      sleeping.

      CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
      for a block, I settled my own and comrade&amp;rsquo;s bill; using, however, my
      comrade&amp;rsquo;s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
      amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me
      and Queequeg&amp;mdash;especially as Peter Coffin&amp;rsquo;s cock and bull stories
      about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
      whom I now companied with.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor
      carpet-bag, and Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to
      &amp;ldquo;the Moss,&amp;rdquo; the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As
      we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much&amp;mdash;for
      they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,&amp;mdash;but at
      seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not,
      going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then
      stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he
      carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling
      ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied,
      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular
      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried
      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In
      short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers&amp;rsquo; 
      meadows armed with their own scythes&amp;mdash;though in no wise obliged to
      furnish them&amp;mdash;even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons,
      preferred his own harpoon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners
      of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest
      to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing&amp;mdash;though
      in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage
      the barrow&amp;mdash;Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then
      shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. &amp;ldquo;Why,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,
      you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn&amp;rsquo;t the people
      laugh?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko,
      it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young
      cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this
      punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where
      the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at
      Rokovoko, and its commander&amp;mdash;from all accounts, a very stately
      punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain&amp;mdash;this commander was
      invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s sister, a pretty young princess
      just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at
      the bride&amp;rsquo;s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned
      the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between
      the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s father. Grace being
      said,&amp;mdash;for those people have their grace as well as we&amp;mdash;though
      Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our
      platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the
      great Giver of all feasts&amp;mdash;Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest
      opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is,
      dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the
      blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and
      noting the ceremony, and thinking himself&amp;mdash;being Captain of a ship&amp;mdash;as
      having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King&amp;rsquo;s
      own house&amp;mdash;the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
      punchbowl;&amp;mdash;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. &amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; said
      Queequeg, &amp;ldquo;what you tink now?&amp;mdash;Didn&amp;rsquo;t our people laugh?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.
      Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford
      rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the
      clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled
      upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay
      silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of
      carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt
      the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one
      most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second
      ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the
      endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
      Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.
      How I snuffed that Tartar air!&amp;mdash;how I spurned that turnpike earth!&amp;mdash;that
      common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs;
      and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no
      records.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His
      dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On,
      on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;
      ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning,
      we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall
      masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this
      reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some
      time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
      lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
      whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by
      their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all
      verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind
      his back. I thought the bumpkin&amp;rsquo;s hour of doom was come. Dropping his
      harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
      miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;
      then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with
      bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,
      lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Capting! Capting!&amp;rdquo; yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
      &amp;ldquo;Capting, Capting, here&amp;rsquo;s the devil.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hallo, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; sir,&amp;rdquo; cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,
      stalking up to Queequeg, &amp;ldquo;what in thunder do you mean by that? Don&amp;rsquo;t you
      know you might have killed that chap?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What him say?&amp;rdquo; said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He say,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;that you came near kill-e that man there,&amp;rdquo; pointing to
      the still shivering greenhorn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Kill-e,&amp;rdquo; cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
      expression of disdain, &amp;ldquo;ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so
      small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look you,&amp;rdquo; roared the Captain, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll kill-e &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, you cannibal, if you try
      any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
      mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the
      weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,
      completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow
      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were
      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed
      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking
      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into
      splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;
      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it
      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this
      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under
      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the
      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the
      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that
      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and
      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to
      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For
      three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long
      arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders
      through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but
      saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself
      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant&amp;rsquo;s glance
      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and
      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking
      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked
      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble
      trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg
      like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at
      all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only
      asked for water&amp;mdash;fresh water&amp;mdash;something to wipe the brine off;
      that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against
      the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
      himself&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
      cannibals must help these Christians.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
      fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the
      world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than
      the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it&amp;mdash;a mere hillock, and elbow of
      sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you
      would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
      gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
      don&amp;rsquo;t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to
      send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of
      wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome;
      that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the
      shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades
      in a day&amp;rsquo;s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
      Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way
      inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to
      their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering,
      as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that
      Nantucket is no Illinois.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled
      by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down
      upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his
      talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight
      over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction.
      Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the
      island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,&amp;mdash;the poor little
      Indian&amp;rsquo;s skeleton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take
      to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the
      sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
      experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
      launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
      put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
      Behring&amp;rsquo;s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting
      war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most
      monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,
      clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very
      panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious
      assaults!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
      their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so
      many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and
      Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add
      Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all
      India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this
      terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer&amp;rsquo;s. For the sea is his; he owns it,
      as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through
      it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating
      forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen
      the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
      themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep
      itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone,
      in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as
      his own special plantation. &lt;i&gt;There&lt;/i&gt; is his home; &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt; lies his business,
      which a Noah&amp;rsquo;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the
      millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;
      he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the
      Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at
      last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to
      an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and
      is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out
      of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under
      his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
      anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business
      that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the
      Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots,
      whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in
      all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he
      called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that
      we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the
      directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our
      starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then
      keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to
      the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the
      place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,
      especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse&amp;mdash;our
      first point of departure&amp;mdash;must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
      I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by
      dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a
      peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something
      which there was no mistaking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses&amp;rsquo; ears,
      swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old
      doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so
      that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was
      over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help
      staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my
      neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; of them, one for
      Queequeg, and one for me. It&amp;rsquo;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper
      upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the
      whalemen&amp;rsquo;s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots
      too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with
      yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a
      dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and
      carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Get along with ye,&amp;rdquo; said she to the man, &amp;ldquo;or I&amp;rsquo;ll be combing ye!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come on, Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;all right. There&amp;rsquo;s Mrs. Hussey.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs.
      Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known
      our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further
      scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at
      a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned
      round to us and said&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Clam or Cod?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that about Cods, ma&amp;rsquo;am?&amp;rdquo; said I, with much politeness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Clam or Cod?&amp;rdquo; she repeated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A clam for supper? a cold clam; is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?&amp;rdquo; says
      I, &amp;ldquo;but that&amp;rsquo;s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time,
      ain&amp;rsquo;t it, Mrs. Hussey?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt,
      who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the
      word &amp;ldquo;clam,&amp;rdquo; Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the
      kitchen, and bawling out &amp;ldquo;clam for two,&amp;rdquo; disappeared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;do you think that we can make out a supper for us
      both on one clam?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
      apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
      came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
      hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
      hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into
      little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned
      with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage,
      and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him,
      and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great
      expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&amp;rsquo;s
      clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.
      Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word &amp;ldquo;cod&amp;rdquo; with great
      emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came
      forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
      cod-chowder was placed before us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to
      myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What&amp;rsquo;s that
      stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? &amp;ldquo;But look, Queequeg, ain&amp;rsquo;t
      that a live eel in your bowl? Where&amp;rsquo;s your harpoon?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
      name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
      breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began
      to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the
      house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of
      codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior
      old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could
      not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along
      the beach among some fishermen&amp;rsquo;s boats, I saw Hosea&amp;rsquo;s brindled cow feeding
      on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&amp;rsquo;s
      decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
      concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede
      me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his
      harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. &amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo; said I; &amp;ldquo;every
      true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon&amp;mdash;but why not?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because it&amp;rsquo;s
      dangerous,&amp;rdquo; says she. &amp;ldquo;Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort&amp;rsquo;nt
      v&amp;rsquo;y&amp;rsquo;ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three
      barrels of &lt;i&gt;ile&lt;/i&gt;, was found dead in my first floor back, with his
      harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich
      dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg&amp;rdquo; (for she had
      learned his name), &amp;ldquo;I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you
      till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Both,&amp;rdquo; says I; &amp;ldquo;and let&amp;rsquo;s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
      variety.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a name=&#34;link2HCH0016&#34; id=&#34;link2HCH0016&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
      small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
      diligently consulting Yojo&amp;mdash;the name of his black little god&amp;mdash;and
      Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
      everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
      harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo
      earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with
      me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had
      already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael,
      should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned
      out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the
      present irrespective of Queequeg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
      confidence in the excellence of Yojo&amp;rsquo;s judgment and surprising forecast of
      things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort
      of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did
      not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, this plan of Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s, or rather Yojo&amp;rsquo;s, touching the selection of
      our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and
      our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon
      Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set
      about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,
      that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning
      early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom&amp;mdash;for
      it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting,
      humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; it was I
      never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I
      never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles&amp;mdash;leaving
      Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at
      his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After
      much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there
      were three ships up for three-years&amp;rsquo; voyages&amp;mdash;The Devil-dam, the
      Tit-bit, and the Pequod. &lt;i&gt;Devil-Dam&lt;/i&gt;, I do not know the origin of; &lt;i&gt;Tit-bit&lt;/i&gt;
      is obvious; &lt;i&gt;Pequod&lt;/i&gt;, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a
      celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient
      Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to
      the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
      a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;&amp;mdash;square-toed
      luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not;
      but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same
      rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if
      anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned
      and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old
      hull&amp;rsquo;s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier&amp;rsquo;s, who has alike
      fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts&amp;mdash;cut
      somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
      overboard in a gale&amp;mdash;her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
      the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled,
      like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where
      Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and
      marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than
      half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her
      chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a
      retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,&amp;mdash;this
      old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her
      original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of
      material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake&amp;rsquo;s
      carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian
      emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing
      of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm
      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons
      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly
      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her
      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one
      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary
      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the
      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble
      craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with
      that.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
      in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw
      nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather
      wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary
      erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;
      consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the
      middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their
      broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually
      sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where
      the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
      Pottowottamie Sachem&amp;rsquo;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows
      of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
      his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
      ship&amp;rsquo;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
      command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over
      with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout
      interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the
      elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and
      heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there
      was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles
      interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual
      sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;&amp;mdash;for
      this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such
      eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Is this the Captain of the Pequod?&amp;rdquo; said I, advancing to the door of the
      tent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?&amp;rdquo;
       he demanded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I was thinking of shipping.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer&amp;mdash;ever been in a
      stove boat?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, Sir, I never have.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say&amp;mdash;eh?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I&amp;rsquo;ve been several
      voyages in the merchant service, and I think that&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll
      take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant
      service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel
      considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!
      man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?&amp;mdash;it looks a little
      suspicious, don&amp;rsquo;t it, eh?&amp;mdash;Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?&amp;mdash;Didst
      not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?&amp;mdash;Dost not think of murdering
      the officers when thou gettest to sea?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
      these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish
      Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of
      all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
      shipping ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who is Captain Ahab, sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s who ye are speaking to,
      young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
      out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
      are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to
      know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of
      finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye
      on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
      up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!&amp;mdash;ah,
      ah!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the
      hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,
      &amp;ldquo;What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was
      any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have
      inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&amp;rsquo;ye see; thou dost
      not talk shark a bit. &lt;i&gt;Sure&lt;/i&gt;, ye&amp;rsquo;ve been to sea before now; sure of that?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
      merchant&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t
      aggravate me&amp;mdash;I won&amp;rsquo;t have it. But let us understand each other. I
      have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for
      it?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I do, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale&amp;rsquo;s
      throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be
      got rid of, that is; which I don&amp;rsquo;t take to be the fact.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out
      by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the
      world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step
      forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me
      and tell me what ye see there.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing
      exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
      concentrating all his crow&amp;rsquo;s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me
      on the errand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship
      swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing
      towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly
      monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, what&amp;rsquo;s the report?&amp;rdquo; said Peleg when I came back; &amp;ldquo;what did ye see?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not much,&amp;rdquo; I replied&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;nothing but water; considerable horizon
      though, and there&amp;rsquo;s a squall coming up, I think.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
      round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can&amp;rsquo;t ye see the world where
      you stand?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
      Pequod was as good a ship as any&amp;mdash;I thought the best&amp;mdash;and all
      this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
      willingness to ship me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,&amp;rdquo; he added&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;come
      along with ye.&amp;rdquo; And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising
      figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg
      was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is
      sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old
      annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning
      about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in
      the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the
      same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good
      interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker,
      the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day
      its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities
      of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things
      altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the
      most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting
      Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture
      names&amp;mdash;a singularly common fashion on the island&amp;mdash;and in
      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure
      of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown
      peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a
      Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things
      unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain
      and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many
      long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations
      never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and
      independently; receiving all nature&amp;rsquo;s sweet or savage impressions fresh
      from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,
      but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous
      lofty language&amp;mdash;that man makes one in a whole nation&amp;rsquo;s census&amp;mdash;a
      mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all
      detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
      circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at
      the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through
      a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal
      greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,
      but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only
      results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual
      circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But
      unlike Captain Peleg&amp;mdash;who cared not a rush for what are called
      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
      veriest of all trifles&amp;mdash;Captain Bildad had not only been originally
      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all
      his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
      creatures, round the Horn&amp;mdash;all that had not moved this native born
      Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.
      Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe
      to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns
      upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his
      days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
      not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he
      had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&amp;rsquo;s
      religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world
      pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the
      drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from
      that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship
      owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by
      wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and
      dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned
      income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
      incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
      task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
      curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
      upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore
      exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was
      certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,
      though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity
      of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate,
      to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel
      completely nervous, till you could clutch something&amp;mdash;a hammer or a
      marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind
      what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the
      exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he
      carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
      economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
      followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
      was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and
      never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed
      beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned
      up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from
      a ponderous volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bildad,&amp;rdquo; cried Captain Peleg, &amp;ldquo;at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
      studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
      knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,
      without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing
      me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He says he&amp;rsquo;s our man, Bildad,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg, &amp;ldquo;he wants to ship.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Dost thee?&amp;rdquo; said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I &lt;i&gt;dost&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;rdquo; said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do ye think of him, Bildad?&amp;rdquo; said Peleg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;ll do,&amp;rdquo; said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his
      book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his
      friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only
      looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth
      the ship&amp;rsquo;s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at
      a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at
      what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already
      aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands,
      including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called &lt;i&gt;lays&lt;/i&gt;,
      and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance
      pertaining to the respective duties of the ship&amp;rsquo;s company. I was also
      aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
      large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,
      splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I
      should be offered at least the 275th lay&amp;mdash;that is, the 275th part of
      the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually
      amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather &lt;i&gt;long lay&lt;/i&gt;,
      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty
      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my
      three years&amp;rsquo; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
      fortune&amp;mdash;and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
      that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
      world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim
      sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay
      would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I
      been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the
      other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole
      management of the ship&amp;rsquo;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what
      the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping
      hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home
      there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now
      while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old
      Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an
      interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on
      mumbling to himself out of his book, &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Lay&lt;/i&gt; not up for yourselves treasures
      upon earth, where moth&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, Captain Bildad,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Peleg, &amp;ldquo;what d&amp;rsquo;ye say, what lay shall
      we give this young man?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou knowest best,&amp;rdquo; was the sepulchral reply, &amp;ldquo;the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much, would it?&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;where moth and rust
      do corrupt, but &lt;i&gt;lay&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Lay&lt;/i&gt;, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
      shall not &lt;i&gt;lay&lt;/i&gt; up many &lt;i&gt;lays&lt;/i&gt; here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It
      was an exceedingly &lt;i&gt;long lay&lt;/i&gt; that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of
      the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest
      consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a
      pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a &lt;i&gt;teenth&lt;/i&gt; of it, you will
      then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a
      farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold
      doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,&amp;rdquo; cried Peleg, &amp;ldquo;thou dost not want to
      swindle this young man! he must have more than that.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,&amp;rdquo; again said Bildad, without lifting
      his eyes; and then went on mumbling&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;for where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg, &amp;ldquo;do ye
      hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, &amp;ldquo;Captain
      Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou
      owest to the other owners of this ship&amp;mdash;widows and orphans, many of
      them&amp;mdash;and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young
      man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The
      seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou Bildad!&amp;rdquo; roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.
      &amp;ldquo;Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,
      I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough
      to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Peleg,&amp;rdquo; said Bildad steadily, &amp;ldquo;thy conscience may be drawing ten
      inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&amp;rsquo;t tell; but as thou art still an
      impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a
      leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,
      Captain Peleg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
      insult me. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&amp;rsquo;s
      bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start
      my soul-bolts, but I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;mdash;yes, I&amp;rsquo;ll swallow a live goat
      with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
      drab-coloured son of a wooden gun&amp;mdash;a straight wake with ye!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
      oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
      responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
      idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
      commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I
      made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath
      of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very
      quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He
      seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after
      letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he,
      too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still
      nervously agitated. &amp;ldquo;Whew!&amp;rdquo; he whistled at last&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the squall&amp;rsquo;s gone
      off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a
      lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.
      That&amp;rsquo;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&amp;rsquo;s thy name,
      didn&amp;rsquo;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three
      hundredth lay.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Peleg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;I have a friend with me who wants to ship too&amp;mdash;shall
      I bring him down to-morrow?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;To be sure,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg. &amp;ldquo;Fetch him along, and we&amp;rsquo;ll look at him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What lay does he want?&amp;rdquo; groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
      which he had again been burying himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg. &amp;ldquo;Has he ever whaled
      it any?&amp;rdquo; turning to me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, bring him along then.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had
      done a good morning&amp;rsquo;s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship
      that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain
      with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many
      cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her
      crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take
      command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore
      intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family,
      or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself
      much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is
      ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before
      irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted
      Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&amp;rsquo;s all right enough; thou art
      shipped.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes, but I should like to see him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly
      what&amp;rsquo;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of
      sick, and yet he don&amp;rsquo;t look so. In fact, he ain&amp;rsquo;t sick; but no, he isn&amp;rsquo;t
      well either. Any how, young man, he won&amp;rsquo;t always see me, so I don&amp;rsquo;t
      suppose he will thee. He&amp;rsquo;s a queer man, Captain Ahab&amp;mdash;so some think&amp;mdash;but
      a good one. Oh, thou&amp;rsquo;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&amp;rsquo;s a
      grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak much; but, when
      he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&amp;rsquo;s
      above the common; Ahab&amp;rsquo;s been in colleges, as well as &amp;rsquo;mong the cannibals;
      been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in
      mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the
      surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&amp;rsquo;t Captain Bildad; no, and he
      ain&amp;rsquo;t Captain Peleg; &lt;i&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s Ahab&lt;/i&gt;, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a
      crowned king!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they
      not lick his blood?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come hither to me&amp;mdash;hither, hither,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg, with a significance
      in his eye that almost startled me. &amp;ldquo;Look ye, lad; never say that on board
      the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
      &amp;rsquo;Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when
      he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead,
      said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other
      fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It&amp;rsquo;s a lie. I
      know Captain Ahab well; I&amp;rsquo;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know
      what he is&amp;mdash;a good man&amp;mdash;not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but
      a swearing good man&amp;mdash;something like me&amp;mdash;only there&amp;rsquo;s a good deal
      more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know
      that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but
      it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
      about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg
      last voyage by that accursed whale, he&amp;rsquo;s been a kind of moody&amp;mdash;desperate
      moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all,
      let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it&amp;rsquo;s better to sail with a
      moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee&amp;mdash;and
      wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides,
      my boy, he has a wife&amp;mdash;not three voyages wedded&amp;mdash;a sweet,
      resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child:
      hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my
      lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally
      revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of
      painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy
      and a sorrow for him, but for I don&amp;rsquo;t know what, unless it was the cruel
      loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort
      of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know
      what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him;
      though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so
      imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at
      length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab
      slipped my mind.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
      day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
      cherish the greatest respect towards everybody&amp;rsquo;s religious obligations,
      never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
      even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
      creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
      quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a
      deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions
      yet owned and rented in his name.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
      things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
      pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
      subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd
      notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;&amp;mdash;but what of that? Queequeg
      thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and
      there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be,
      I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&amp;mdash;Presbyterians and Pagans
      alike&amp;mdash;for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
      sadly need mending.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals
      must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no
      answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I
      softly through the key-hole:&amp;mdash;all silent. &amp;ldquo;I say, Queequeg! why don&amp;rsquo;t
      you speak? It&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;mdash;Ishmael.&amp;rdquo; But all remained still as before. I
      began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he
      might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the
      door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but
      a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the
      bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold
      resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s harpoon, which the
      landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to
      the chamber. That&amp;rsquo;s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon
      stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he
      must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg!&amp;mdash;Queequeg!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;all still. Something must have happened.
      Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
      Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I
      met&amp;mdash;the chamber-maid. &amp;ldquo;La! la!&amp;rdquo; she cried, &amp;ldquo;I thought something must
      be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
      locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it&amp;rsquo;s been just so silent ever
      since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
      baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma&amp;rsquo;am!&amp;mdash;Mistress! murder! Mrs.
      Hussey! apoplexy!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and with these cries, she ran towards the
      kitchen, I following.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
      vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of
      attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wood-house!&amp;rdquo; cried I, &amp;ldquo;which way to it? Run for God&amp;rsquo;s sake, and fetch
      something to pry open the door&amp;mdash;the axe!&amp;mdash;the axe! he&amp;rsquo;s had a
      stroke; depend upon it!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
      up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot
      and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter with you, young man?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Get the axe! For God&amp;rsquo;s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it
      open!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look here,&amp;rdquo; said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so
      as to have one hand free; &amp;ldquo;look here; are you talking about prying open
      any of my doors?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and with that she seized my arm. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the
      matter with you? What&amp;rsquo;s the matter with you, shipmate?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
      whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
      nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;No! I haven&amp;rsquo;t
      seen it since I put it there.&amp;rdquo; Running to a little closet under the
      landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s harpoon was missing. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s killed himself,&amp;rdquo; she cried. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s
      unfort&amp;rsquo;nate Stiggs done over again&amp;mdash;there goes another counterpane&amp;mdash;God
      pity his poor mother!&amp;mdash;it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor
      lad a sister? Where&amp;rsquo;s that girl?&amp;mdash;there, Betty, go to Snarles the
      Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;no suicides
      permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;might as well kill
      both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What&amp;rsquo;s that
      noise there? You, young man, avast there!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open
      the door.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t allow it; I won&amp;rsquo;t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,
      there&amp;rsquo;s one about a mile from here. But avast!&amp;rdquo; putting her hand in her
      side-pocket, &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s a key that&amp;rsquo;ll fit, I guess; let&amp;rsquo;s see.&amp;rdquo; And with
      that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s supplemental bolt
      remained unwithdrawn within.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Have to burst it open,&amp;rdquo; said I, and was running down the entry a little,
      for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should
      not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily
      rush dashed myself full against the mark.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against
      the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there
      sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of
      the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He
      looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with
      scarce a sign of active life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, going up to him, &amp;ldquo;Queequeg, what&amp;rsquo;s the matter with
      you?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He hain&amp;rsquo;t been a sittin&amp;rsquo; so all day, has he?&amp;rdquo; said the landlady.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like
      pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
      intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
      especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
      eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mrs. Hussey,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt; at all events; so leave us, if you
      please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg
      to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do&amp;mdash;for
      all my polite arts and blandishments&amp;mdash;he would not move a peg, nor
      say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the
      slightest way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
      they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,
      it&amp;rsquo;s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he&amp;rsquo;ll get up
      sooner or later, no doubt. It can&amp;rsquo;t last for ever, thank God, and his
      Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s very punctual
      then.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
      stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as
      they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
      confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
      listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o&amp;rsquo;clock, I went up
      stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
      certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was
      just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow
      vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting
      there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a
      piece of wood on his head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;For heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
      some supper. You&amp;rsquo;ll starve; you&amp;rsquo;ll kill yourself, Queequeg.&amp;rdquo; But not a
      word did he reply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and
      no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
      turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it
      promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
      round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the
      faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of
      Queequeg&amp;mdash;not four feet off&amp;mdash;sitting there in that uneasy
      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
      Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan
      on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had
      been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun
      entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a
      cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again
      against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person&amp;rsquo;s religion, be
      it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other
      person, because that other person don&amp;rsquo;t believe it also. But when a man&amp;rsquo;s
      religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;
      and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;
      then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the
      point with him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And just so I now did with Queequeg. &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;get into bed
      now, and lie and listen to me.&amp;rdquo; I then went on, beginning with the rise
      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in
      cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for
      the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common
      sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely
      sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see
      him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.
      Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves
      in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This
      is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy
      notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather
      digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;
      and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by
      Ramadans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
      expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;
      only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his
      father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the
      enemy had been killed by about two o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and all
      cooked and eaten that very evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No more, Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, shuddering; &amp;ldquo;that will do;&amp;rdquo; for I knew the
      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had
      visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a
      great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard
      or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great
      wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and
      cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the
      victor&amp;rsquo;s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents
      were so many Christmas turkeys.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
      dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own
      point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third
      understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt
      thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He
      looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as
      though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be
      so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
      breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make
      much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
      sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
      carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
      from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and
      furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
      unless they previously produced their papers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?&amp;rdquo; said I, now jumping on the
      bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I mean,&amp;rdquo; he replied, &amp;ldquo;he must show his papers.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
      behind Peleg&amp;rsquo;s, out of the wigwam. &amp;ldquo;He must show that he&amp;rsquo;s converted. Son
      of darkness,&amp;rdquo; he added, turning to Queequeg, &amp;ldquo;art thou at present in
      communion with any Christian church?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s a member of the first Congregational Church.&amp;rdquo; Here be
      it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last
      come to be converted into the churches.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;First Congregational Church,&amp;rdquo; cried Bildad, &amp;ldquo;what! that worships in
      Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman&amp;rsquo;s meeting-house?&amp;rdquo; and so saying, taking out his
      spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and
      putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning
      stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;How long hath he been a member?&amp;rdquo; he then said, turning to me; &amp;ldquo;not very
      long, I rather guess, young man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg, &amp;ldquo;and he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been baptized right either, or it would
      have washed some of that devil&amp;rsquo;s blue off his face.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do tell, now,&amp;rdquo; cried Bildad, &amp;ldquo;is this Philistine a regular member of
      Deacon Deuteronomy&amp;rsquo;s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
      every Lord&amp;rsquo;s day.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,&amp;rdquo; said I;
      &amp;ldquo;all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
      Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Young man,&amp;rdquo; said Bildad sternly, &amp;ldquo;thou art skylarking with me&amp;mdash;explain
      thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. &amp;ldquo;I mean, sir, the same ancient
      Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg
      here, and all of us, and every mother&amp;rsquo;s son and soul of us belong; the
      great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;
      we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no
      ways touching the grand belief; in &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; we all join hands.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Splice, thou mean&amp;rsquo;st &lt;i&gt;splice&lt;/i&gt; hands,&amp;rdquo; cried Peleg, drawing nearer. &amp;ldquo;Young
      man, you&amp;rsquo;d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I
      never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy&amp;mdash;why Father Mapple
      himself couldn&amp;rsquo;t beat it, and he&amp;rsquo;s reckoned something. Come aboard, come
      aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there&amp;mdash;what&amp;rsquo;s
      that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a
      harpoon he&amp;rsquo;s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it
      about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
      in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the
      bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to
      the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried
      out in some such way as this:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cap&amp;rsquo;ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
      spose him one whale eye, well, den!&amp;rdquo; and taking sharp aim at it, he darted
      the iron right over old Bildad&amp;rsquo;s broad brim, clean across the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, &amp;ldquo;spos-ee him whale-e
      eye; why, dad whale dead.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Quick, Bildad,&amp;rdquo; said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
      vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
      &amp;ldquo;Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship&amp;rsquo;s papers. We must have
      Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we&amp;rsquo;ll
      give ye the ninetieth lay, and that&amp;rsquo;s more than ever was given a
      harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
      enrolled among the same ship&amp;rsquo;s company to which I myself belonged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
      signing, he turned to me and said, &amp;ldquo;I guess, Quohog there don&amp;rsquo;t know how
      to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
      make thy mark?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part
      in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen,
      copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a
      queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through
      Captain Peleg&amp;rsquo;s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood
      something like this:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Quohog. his X mark.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
      and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
      broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
      entitled &amp;ldquo;The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,&amp;rdquo; placed it in
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
      looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, &amp;ldquo;Son of darkness, I must do my
      duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
      souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I
      sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
      the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
      thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad&amp;rsquo;s language,
      heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,&amp;rdquo;
       cried Peleg. &amp;ldquo;Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers&amp;mdash;it takes the shark out of &amp;rsquo;em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.
      There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all
      Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.
      He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered
      away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went
      to Davy Jones.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Peleg! Peleg!&amp;rdquo; said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, &amp;ldquo;thou thyself, as
      I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is
      to have the fear of death; how, then, can&amp;rsquo;st thou prate in this ungodly
      guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod
      here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same
      voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did&amp;rsquo;st thou not think of
      Death and the Judgment then?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hear him, hear him now,&amp;rdquo; cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
      thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;hear him, all of ye.
      Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and
      the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting
      thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.
      Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death
      then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save
      all hands&amp;mdash;how to rig jury-masts&amp;mdash;how to get into the nearest
      port; that was what I was thinking of.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we
      followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who
      were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a
      patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been
      wasted.

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the
      water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above
      words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his
      massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily
      apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black
      handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
      directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
      bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Have ye shipped in her?&amp;rdquo; he repeated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,&amp;rdquo; said I, trying to gain a little
      more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, the Pequod&amp;mdash;that ship there,&amp;rdquo; he said, drawing back his whole
      arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
      bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;we have just signed the articles.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Anything down there about your souls?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;About what?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, perhaps you hav&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;t got any,&amp;rdquo; he said quickly. &amp;ldquo;No matter though, I
      know many chaps that hav&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;t got any,&amp;mdash;good luck to &amp;rsquo;em; and they are
      all the better off for it. A soul&amp;rsquo;s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What are you jabbering about, shipmate?&amp;rdquo; said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/i&gt; got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in
      other chaps,&amp;rdquo; abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon
      the word &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s go; this fellow has broken loose from
      somewhere; he&amp;rsquo;s talking about something and somebody we don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stop!&amp;rdquo; cried the stranger. &amp;ldquo;Ye said true&amp;mdash;ye hav&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;t seen Old
      Thunder yet, have ye?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Old Thunder?&amp;rdquo; said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of
      his manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;t
      seen him yet, have ye?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, we hav&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;t. He&amp;rsquo;s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
      all right again before long.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All right again before long!&amp;rdquo; laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
      derisive sort of laugh. &amp;ldquo;Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
      this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do you know about him?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What did they &lt;i&gt;tell&lt;/i&gt; you about him? Say that!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;They didn&amp;rsquo;t tell much of anything about him; only I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that he&amp;rsquo;s a
      good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s true, that&amp;rsquo;s true&amp;mdash;yes, both true enough. But you must jump
      when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s the word
      with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
      Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
      nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in
      Santa?&amp;mdash;heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
      calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
      according to the prophecy. Didn&amp;rsquo;t ye hear a word about them matters and
      something more, eh? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?
      Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows&amp;rsquo;ever, mayhap, ye&amp;rsquo;ve heard tell about
      the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh
      yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; every one knows a&amp;rsquo;most&amp;mdash;I mean they know he&amp;rsquo;s only one leg;
      and that a parmacetti took the other off.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;My friend,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don&amp;rsquo;t
      know, and I don&amp;rsquo;t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little
      damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship
      there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of
      his leg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; about it, eh&amp;mdash;sure you do?&amp;mdash;all?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pretty sure.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
      stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
      little, turned and said:&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Ye&amp;rsquo;ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
      papers? Well, well, what&amp;rsquo;s signed, is signed; and what&amp;rsquo;s to be, will be;
      and then again, perhaps it won&amp;rsquo;t be, after all. Anyhow, it&amp;rsquo;s all fixed and
      arranged a&amp;rsquo;ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose;
      as well these as any other men, God pity &amp;rsquo;em! Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I stopped ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look here, friend,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;if you have anything important to tell us,
      out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken
      in your game; that&amp;rsquo;s all I have to say.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And it&amp;rsquo;s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you
      are just the man for him&amp;mdash;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell &amp;rsquo;em I&amp;rsquo;ve concluded not to make one of
      &amp;rsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, you can&amp;rsquo;t fool us that way&amp;mdash;you can&amp;rsquo;t fool us.
      It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
      great secret in him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Morning it is,&amp;rdquo; said I. &amp;ldquo;Come along, Queequeg, let&amp;rsquo;s leave this crazy
      man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Elijah.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other&amp;rsquo;s
      fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a
      humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a
      hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did
      so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
      Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
      his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether
      the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it
      seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for
      the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
      half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
      kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with
      the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn
      fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when
      I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;
      and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
      things.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
      dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and
      on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
      seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
      seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not
      only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board,
      and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened
      that the ship&amp;rsquo;s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg
      seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
      look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at
      the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
      working till long after night-fall.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      On the day following Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s signing the articles, word was given at
      all the inns where the ship&amp;rsquo;s company were stopping, that their chests
      must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
      vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving,
      however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very
      long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.
      But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling
      how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Every one knows what a multitude of things&amp;mdash;beds, sauce-pans, knives
      and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
      indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which
      necessitates a three-years&amp;rsquo; housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all
      grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also
      holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as
      with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the
      numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the
      impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented,
      it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most
      exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and
      loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
      Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and
      spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
      Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel,
      and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was
      a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of
      things, both large and small.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad&amp;rsquo;s
      sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but
      withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; could help it,
      nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting
      to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the
      steward&amp;rsquo;s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&amp;rsquo;s
      desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the
      small of some one&amp;rsquo;s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her
      name, which was Charity&amp;mdash;Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And
      like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about
      hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
      promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship
      in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she
      herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
      board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a
      still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
      Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a
      long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went
      his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg
      came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the
      hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded
      by roaring back into his wigwam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft,
      and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was
      going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,
      that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day;
      meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything
      necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest
      with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but
      half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once
      laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so
      soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any
      wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,
      he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And
      much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly
      sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was nearly six o&amp;rsquo;clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
      drew nigh the wharf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,&amp;rdquo; said I to
      Queequeg, &amp;ldquo;it can&amp;rsquo;t be shadows; she&amp;rsquo;s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast!&amp;rdquo; cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
      us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
      between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
      strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Going aboard?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hands off, will you,&amp;rdquo; said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lookee here,&amp;rdquo; said Queequeg, shaking himself, &amp;ldquo;go &amp;rsquo;way!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ain&amp;rsquo;t going aboard, then?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes, we are,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;but what business is that of yours? Do you know,
      Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, no, no; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of that,&amp;rdquo; said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly
      looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Elijah,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are
      going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
      detained.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s cracked, Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;come on.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Holloa!&amp;rdquo; cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
      paces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Never mind him,&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;Queequeg, come on.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
      shoulder, said&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
      that ship a while ago?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, &amp;ldquo;Yes, I
      thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Very dim, very dim,&amp;rdquo; said Elijah. &amp;ldquo;Morning to ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
      touching my shoulder again, said, &amp;ldquo;See if you can find &amp;rsquo;em now, will ye?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Find who?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Morning to ye! morning to ye!&amp;rdquo; he rejoined, again moving off. &amp;ldquo;Oh! I was
      going to warn ye against&amp;mdash;but never mind, never mind&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s all
      one, all in the family too;&amp;mdash;sharp frost this morning, ain&amp;rsquo;t it?
      Good-bye to ye. Shan&amp;rsquo;t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it&amp;rsquo;s before
      the Grand Jury.&amp;rdquo; And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
      me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
      quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
      hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to
      the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we
      went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered
      pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face
      downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept
      upon him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?&amp;rdquo; said I,
      looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
      Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have
      thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not
      for Elijah&amp;rsquo;s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down;
      and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps
      we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself
      accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper&amp;rsquo;s rear, as though feeling if
      it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Gracious! Queequeg, don&amp;rsquo;t sit there,&amp;rdquo; said I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! perry dood seat,&amp;rdquo; said Queequeg, &amp;ldquo;my country way; won&amp;rsquo;t hurt him
      face.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Face!&amp;rdquo; said I, &amp;ldquo;call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but
      how hard he breathes, he&amp;rsquo;s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are
      heavy, it&amp;rsquo;s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he&amp;rsquo;ll
      twitch you off soon. I wonder he don&amp;rsquo;t wake.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
      lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
      over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him
      in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land,
      owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs,
      and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the
      lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that
      respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them
      round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an
      excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
      walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring
      him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some
      damp marshy place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
      from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper&amp;rsquo;s head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that for, Queequeg?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
      which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
      his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
      strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell
      upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in
      the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his
      eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Holloa!&amp;rdquo; he breathed at last, &amp;ldquo;who be ye smokers?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Shipped men,&amp;rdquo; answered I, &amp;ldquo;when does she sail?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came
      aboard last night.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What Captain?&amp;mdash;Ahab?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who but him indeed?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
      heard a noise on deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Holloa! Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s astir,&amp;rdquo; said the rigger. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a lively chief mate,
      that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.&amp;rdquo; And so
      saying he went on deck, and we followed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes;
      the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and
      several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on
      board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his
      cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a name=&#34;link2HCH0022&#34; id=&#34;link2HCH0022&#34;&gt;
      &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;height: 4em;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship&amp;rsquo;s riggers,
      and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
      ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift&amp;mdash;a
      night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare
      Bible for the steward&amp;mdash;after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and
      Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all
      ready&amp;mdash;just spoke to him&amp;mdash;nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
      Well, call all hands, then. Muster &amp;rsquo;em aft here&amp;mdash;blast &amp;rsquo;em!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,&amp;rdquo; said Bildad,
      &amp;ldquo;but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
      Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
      quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well
      as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him
      was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the
      idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship
      under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at
      all his proper business, but the pilot&amp;rsquo;s; and as he was not yet completely
      recovered&amp;mdash;so they said&amp;mdash;therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.
      And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service
      many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
      heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
      merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good
      with the pilot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg
      was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and
      not Bildad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,&amp;rdquo; he cried, as the sailors lingered at the
      main-mast. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, drive &amp;rsquo;em aft.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Strike the tent there!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;was the next order. As I hinted before,
      this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
      Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
      be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&amp;mdash;jump!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;was the next
      command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is
      the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
      known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
      of the port&amp;mdash;he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
      order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
      in, for he never piloted any other craft&amp;mdash;Bildad, I say, might now be
      seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,
      and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer
      the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about
      the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three
      days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
      on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his
      sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman&amp;rsquo;s berth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and
      swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink
      the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my
      handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we
      both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was
      comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be
      found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;
      when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was
      horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his
      leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?&amp;rdquo; he roared. &amp;ldquo;Spring,
      thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don&amp;rsquo;t ye spring, I
      say, all of ye&amp;mdash;spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
      whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
      say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!&amp;rdquo; And so saying, he moved along
      the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
      imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain
      Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a
      short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we
      found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray
      cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the
      bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of
      some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
      old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all
      over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes
      were heard,&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
         Stand dressed in living green.
      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
         While Jordan rolled between.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were
      full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
      boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
      yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and
      glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
      untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
      longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
      alongside.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
      this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very
      loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage&amp;mdash;beyond
      both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned
      dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;
      a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors
      of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful
      of every interest to him,&amp;mdash;poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the
      deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another
      farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked
      towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen
      Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right
      and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling
      a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and
      holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as
      much as to say, &amp;ldquo;Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his
      philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came
      too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck&amp;mdash;now a
      word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
      him,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Captain Bildad&amp;mdash;come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
      main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
      Careful, careful!&amp;mdash;come, Bildad, boy&amp;mdash;say your last. Luck to ye,
      Starbuck&amp;mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&amp;mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Flask&amp;mdash;good-bye
      and good luck to ye all&amp;mdash;and this day three years I&amp;rsquo;ll have a hot
      supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,&amp;rdquo; murmured old Bildad,
      almost incoherently. &amp;ldquo;I hope ye&amp;rsquo;ll have fine weather now, so that Captain
      Ahab may soon be moving among ye&amp;mdash;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and
      ye&amp;rsquo;ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the
      hunt, ye mates. Don&amp;rsquo;t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good
      white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don&amp;rsquo;t
      forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don&amp;rsquo;t waste
      the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don&amp;rsquo;t
      whale it too much a&amp;rsquo; Lord&amp;rsquo;s days, men; but don&amp;rsquo;t miss a fair chance
      either, that&amp;rsquo;s rejecting Heaven&amp;rsquo;s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses
      tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the
      islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don&amp;rsquo;t keep
      that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it&amp;rsquo;ll spoil. Be
      careful with the butter&amp;mdash;twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,
      if&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,&amp;mdash;away!&amp;rdquo; and with that,
      Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
      screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three
      heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
      Atlantic.

      CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
      mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When on that shivering winter&amp;rsquo;s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
      bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm
      but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the
      man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years&amp;rsquo; dangerous voyage,
      could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.
      The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the
      unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is
      the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him
      as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward
      land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
      safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that&amp;rsquo;s
      kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that
      ship&amp;rsquo;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
      though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.
      With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights
      &amp;rsquo;gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the
      lashed sea&amp;rsquo;s landlessness again; for refuge&amp;rsquo;s sake forlornly rushing into
      peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,
      slavish shore?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite
      as God&amp;mdash;so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be
      ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,
      then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all
      this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee
      grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing&amp;mdash;straight
      up, leaps thy apotheosis!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and
      as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen
      as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all
      anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us
      hunters of whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the
      fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted
      on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger
      were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but
      slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to
      the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval
      officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his
      visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming
      and ridiculous.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen,
      is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering
      sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are
      surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true.
      But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all
      Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as
      for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon
      be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and
      which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at
      least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting
      the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
      whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
      battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies&amp;rsquo; 
      plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of
      the soldier&amp;rsquo;s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has
      freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of
      the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.
      For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the
      interlinked terrors and wonders of God!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly
      pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost
      all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as
      before so many shrines, to our glory!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales;
      see what we whalemen are, and have been.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Why did the Dutch in De Witt&amp;rsquo;s time have admirals of their whaling fleets?
      Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling
      ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of
      families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the
      years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of Â£1,000,000?
      And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the
      rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven
      hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming
      4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing,
      $20,000,000! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped
      harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something
      puissant in whaling?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But this is not the half; look again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
      point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years
      has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one
      aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and
      another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well
      be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue
      all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the
      whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least
      known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which
      had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and
      European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them
      fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally
      showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.
      They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
      Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have
      sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook
      and your Krusenstern. For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in
      the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin
      islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his
      marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such
      a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
      life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which
      Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of
      being set down in the ship&amp;rsquo;s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
      scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and
      the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It
      was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish
      crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be
      distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation
      of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the
      establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given
      to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born
      discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as
      pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship
      is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of
      the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved
      from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily
      dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia
      confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that
      cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases
      carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that
      double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the
      whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the
      threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
      Ã¦sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
      shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
      every time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will
      say.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?&lt;/i&gt; Who wrote
      the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed
      the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than
      Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
      Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our
      glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
      good blood in their veins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;No good blood in their veins?&lt;/i&gt; They have something better than royal blood
      there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards,
      by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the
      ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers&amp;mdash;all kith and
      kin to noble Benjamin&amp;mdash;this day darting the barbed iron from one side
      of the world to the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Whaling not respectable?&lt;/i&gt; Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory
      law, the whale is declared &amp;ldquo;a royal fish.&amp;rdquo; *
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand
      imposing way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?&lt;/i&gt; In one of the mighty
      triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world&amp;rsquo;s capital,
      the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the
      most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
      dignity in whaling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;No dignity in whaling?&lt;/i&gt; The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest.
      Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in
      presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man
      that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account
      that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted
      of taking as many walled towns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered
      prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
      but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if
      hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
      have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more
      properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I
      prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a
      whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.

      CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
      substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
      should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
      eloquently upon his cause&amp;mdash;such an advocate, would he not be
      blameworthy?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
      ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
      gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be
      a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely&amp;mdash;who knows?
      Certain I am, however, that a king&amp;rsquo;s head is solemnly oiled at his
      coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint
      it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?
      Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this
      regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and
      contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that
      anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally,
      that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general
      rule, he can&amp;rsquo;t amount to much in his totality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the only thing to be considered here, is this&amp;mdash;what kind of oil
      is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
      oil, nor castor oil, nor bear&amp;rsquo;s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
      What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
      unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens
      with coronation stuff!

      CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
      Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
      coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
      as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would
      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general
      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is
      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried
      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,
      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed
      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the
      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight
      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with
      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck
      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as
      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his
      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into
      his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those
      thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,
      steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of
      action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety
      and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
      affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.
      Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural
      reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly
      incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in
      some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if
      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his
      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend
      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him
      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted
      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in
      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &amp;ldquo;I will have no man in my
      boat,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;who is not afraid of a whale.&amp;rdquo; By this, he seemed
      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which
      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an
      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, the second mate, &amp;ldquo;Starbuck, there, is as careful a
      man as you&amp;rsquo;ll find anywhere in this fishery.&amp;rdquo; But we shall ere long see
      what that word &amp;ldquo;careful&amp;rdquo; precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or
      almost any other whale hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;
      but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally
      practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business
      of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like
      her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had
      no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in
      fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought
      Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living,
      and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been
      so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father&amp;rsquo;s? Where, in
      the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
      superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
      could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it
      was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
      terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that
      these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which,
      under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and
      burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of
      bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally
      abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the
      ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
      terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from
      the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
      abasement of poor Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
      write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the
      fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
      stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
      men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and
      so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious
      blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.
      That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that
      it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with
      keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can
      piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings
      against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not
      the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
      robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick
      or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates
      without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and
      circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
      hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
      graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
      all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch
      that workman&amp;rsquo;s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
      over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me
      out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
      mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
      democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
      pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of
      finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
      pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
      war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
      Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from
      the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!

      CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
      according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
      neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent
      air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling
      away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.
      Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if
      the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited
      guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part
      of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When
      close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his
      unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.
      He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
      most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the
      jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there
      is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable
      dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of
      the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something
      which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing
      man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of
      grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to
      bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have
      been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of
      the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected
      him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept
      a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy
      reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in
      succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then
      loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,
      instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into
      his mouth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
      peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
      ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the
      numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
      cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
      mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb&amp;rsquo;s tobacco
      smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard. A
      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who
      somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and
      hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor
      with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to
      all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and
      mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible
      danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous
      whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,
      requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time
      and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious
      fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he
      followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years&amp;rsquo; voyage round
      Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a
      carpenter&amp;rsquo;s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind
      may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made
      to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the
      Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square
      timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of
      many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship
      against the icy concussions of those battering seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now these three mates&amp;mdash;Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
      men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
      Pequod&amp;rsquo;s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain
      Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these
      three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their
      long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as
      the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
      Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
      who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
      former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
      moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
      and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down
      who the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them
      belonged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for
      his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
      promontory of Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant
      of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of
      Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they
      usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego&amp;rsquo;s long, lean,
      sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes&amp;mdash;for an
      Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering
      expression&amp;mdash;all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the
      unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the
      great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests
      of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
      woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;
      the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of
      the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would
      almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,
      and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate&amp;rsquo;s squire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread&amp;mdash;an Ahasuerus to behold.
      Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors
      called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards
      to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere
      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most
      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of
      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of
      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his
      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white
      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a
      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the
      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the
      residue of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s company, be it said, that at the present day not
      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the
      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the
      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as
      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the
      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and
      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American
      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously
      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to
      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like
      manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the
      Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the
      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no
      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly
      all Islanders in the Pequod, &lt;i&gt;Isolatoes&lt;/i&gt; too, I call such, not acknowledging
      the common continent of men, but each &lt;i&gt;Isolato&lt;/i&gt; living on a separate
      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these
      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the
      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to
      lay the world&amp;rsquo;s grievances before that bar from which not very many of
      them ever come back. Black Little Pip&amp;mdash;he never did&amp;mdash;oh, no! he
      went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod&amp;rsquo;s forecastle, ye shall
      ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,
      when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in
      with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
      hailed a hero there!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
      of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
      and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
      only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
      with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but
      commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,
      though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now
      sacred retreat of the cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed
      aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,
      became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by
      the ragged Elijah&amp;rsquo;s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
      with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly
      could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile
      at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.
      But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness&amp;mdash;to call it so&amp;mdash;which
      I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed
      against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the
      harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,
      heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies
      which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I
      ascribed this&amp;mdash;and rightly ascribed it&amp;mdash;to the fierce uniqueness
      of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
      abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief
      officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to
      allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness
      in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers
      and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and
      they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape
      man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a
      space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from
      it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
      sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and
      gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship
      was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and
      melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the
      forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,
      foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab
      stood upon his quarter-deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the
      fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or
      taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole
      high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
      unalterable mould, like Cellini&amp;rsquo;s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from
      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny
      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a
      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular
      seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the
      upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single
      twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off
      into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether
      that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
      desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,
      throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by
      the mates. But once Tashtego&amp;rsquo;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the
      crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old
      did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild
      hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an
      old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had
      never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old
      sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old
      Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor
      seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
      be tranquilly laid out&amp;mdash;which might hardly come to pass, so he
      muttered&amp;mdash;then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
      would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
      brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
      that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
      white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
      this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the
      sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s jaw. &amp;ldquo;Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,&amp;rdquo; said the old
      Gay-Head Indian once; &amp;ldquo;but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
      mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of &amp;rsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
      the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
      was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His
      bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;
      Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a
      determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
      forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
      officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and
      expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness
      of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody
      stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the
      nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But
      after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing
      in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily
      walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a
      little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the
      ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the
      sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that
      he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,
      or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary
      there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not
      regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision
      the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,
      out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for
      that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
      brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
      upon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
      holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.
      For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to
      the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most
      thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to
      welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little
      respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did
      he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would
      have soon flowered out in a smile.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually
      reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly
      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as
      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up&amp;mdash;flaked up, with
      rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
      jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
      absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, &amp;rsquo;twas
      hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all
      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and
      potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,
      especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her
      crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these
      subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab&amp;rsquo;s texture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the
      old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked
      deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to
      live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the
      cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. &amp;ldquo;It feels like going down into
      one&amp;rsquo;s tomb,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he would mutter to himself&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;for an old captain
      like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
      berth.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and
      when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it
      not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its
      place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of
      steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman
      would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,
      gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering
      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually
      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would
      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him
      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one
      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
      then.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,&amp;rdquo; said Ahab, &amp;ldquo;that thou wouldst wad me that
      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where
      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.&amp;mdash;Down,
      dog, and kennel!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, &amp;ldquo;I
      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
      it, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as
      if to avoid some passionate temptation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, sir; not yet,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, emboldened, &amp;ldquo;I will not tamely be called a
      dog, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
      I&amp;rsquo;ll clear the world of thee!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,&amp;rdquo; muttered
      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s very queer.
      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don&amp;rsquo;t well know whether to go back and strike
      him, or&amp;mdash;what&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;mdash;down here on my knees and pray for him?
      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time
      I ever &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; pray. It&amp;rsquo;s queer; very queer; and he&amp;rsquo;s queer too; aye, take him
      fore and aft, he&amp;rsquo;s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How
      he flashed at me!&amp;mdash;his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway
      there&amp;rsquo;s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a
      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours
      out of the twenty-four; and he don&amp;rsquo;t sleep then. Didn&amp;rsquo;t that Dough-Boy,
      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man&amp;rsquo;s
      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
      guess he&amp;rsquo;s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it&amp;rsquo;s a kind of
      Tic-Dolly-row they say&amp;mdash;worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don&amp;rsquo;t
      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He&amp;rsquo;s full of
      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as
      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what&amp;rsquo;s that for, I should like to know?
      Who&amp;rsquo;s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain&amp;rsquo;t that queer, now? But
      there&amp;rsquo;s no telling, it&amp;rsquo;s the old game&amp;mdash;Here goes for a snooze. Damn
      me, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a fellow&amp;rsquo;s while to be born into the world, if only to fall
      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that&amp;rsquo;s about the first thing
      babies do, and that&amp;rsquo;s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are
      queer, come to think of &amp;rsquo;em. But that&amp;rsquo;s against my principles. Think not,
      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth&amp;mdash;So
      here goes again. But how&amp;rsquo;s that? didn&amp;rsquo;t he call me a dog? blazes! he
      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of &lt;i&gt;that!&lt;/i&gt;
      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; kick me,
      and I didn&amp;rsquo;t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.
      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil&amp;rsquo;s the matter with me? I
      don&amp;rsquo;t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though&amp;mdash;How?
      how? how?&amp;mdash;but the only way&amp;rsquo;s to stash it; so here goes to hammock
      again; and in the morning, I&amp;rsquo;ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over
      by daylight.&amp;rdquo;

      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the
      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting
      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side
      of the deck, he sat and smoked.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one
      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him
      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the
      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in
      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. &amp;ldquo;How now,&amp;rdquo;
       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, &amp;ldquo;this smoking no longer
      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here
      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring&amp;mdash;aye, and
      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such
      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors
      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I&amp;rsquo;ll
      smoke no more&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.
      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man&amp;rsquo;s ivory
      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,
      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!
      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But
      what was still more curious, Flask&amp;mdash;you know how curious all dreams
      are&amp;mdash;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
      kick from Ahab. &amp;lsquo;Why,&amp;rsquo; thinks I, &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the row? It&amp;rsquo;s not a real leg,
      only a false leg.&amp;rsquo; And there&amp;rsquo;s a mighty difference between a living thump
      and a dead thump. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member&amp;mdash;that
      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the
      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed
      pyramid&amp;mdash;so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
      say, I was thinking to myself, &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s his leg now, but a cane&amp;mdash;a
      whalebone cane. Yes,&amp;rsquo; thinks I, &amp;lsquo;it was only a playful cudgelling&amp;mdash;in
      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&amp;mdash;not a base kick. Besides,&amp;rsquo; 
      thinks I, &amp;lsquo;look at it once; why, the end of it&amp;mdash;the foot part&amp;mdash;what
      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
      &lt;i&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/i&gt; a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a
      point only.&amp;rsquo; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I
      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,
      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
      &amp;lsquo;What are you &amp;rsquo;bout?&amp;rsquo; says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a
      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &amp;lsquo;What am I about?&amp;rsquo; 
      says I at last. &amp;lsquo;And what business is that of yours, I should like to
      know, Mr. Humpback? Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want a kick?&amp;rsquo; By the lord, Flask, I had no
      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and
      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout&amp;mdash;what do you think, I
      saw?&amp;mdash;why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &amp;lsquo;I guess I
      won&amp;rsquo;t kick you, old fellow.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Wise Stubb,&amp;rsquo; said he, &amp;lsquo;wise Stubb;&amp;rsquo; and kept
      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney
      hag. Seeing he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to stop saying over his &amp;lsquo;wise Stubb, wise
      Stubb,&amp;rsquo; I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I
      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, &amp;lsquo;Stop that
      kicking!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Halloa,&amp;rsquo; says I, &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the matter now, old fellow?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Look ye
      here,&amp;rsquo; says he; &amp;lsquo;let&amp;rsquo;s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn&amp;rsquo;t
      he?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes, he did,&amp;rsquo; says I&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;right &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; it was.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Very good,&amp;rsquo; says he&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;he
      used his ivory leg, didn&amp;rsquo;t he?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes, he did,&amp;rsquo; says I. &amp;lsquo;Well then,&amp;rsquo; says
      he, &amp;lsquo;wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn&amp;rsquo;t he kick with right
      good will? it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,
      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.
      It&amp;rsquo;s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old
      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
      and made garter-knights of; but, be &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked
      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; kicked by
      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can&amp;rsquo;t
      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don&amp;rsquo;t you see that pyramid?&amp;rsquo; With that, he all
      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the
      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do
      you think of that dream, Flask?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;May be; may be. But it&amp;rsquo;s made a wise man of me, Flask. D&amp;rsquo;ye see Ahab
      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you
      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever
      he says. Halloa! What&amp;rsquo;s that he shouts? Hark!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do you think of that now, Flask? ain&amp;rsquo;t there a small drop of
      something queer about that, eh? A white whale&amp;mdash;did ye mark that, man?
      Look ye&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,
      Flask. Ahab has that that&amp;rsquo;s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this
      way.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in
      its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the
      Pequod&amp;rsquo;s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
      leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
      indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special
      leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that
      I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
      Cetology,&amp;rdquo; says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as
      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *
      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal&amp;rdquo; (sperm whale),
      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.&amp;rdquo;
       &amp;ldquo;Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A field strewn
      with thorns.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us
      naturalists.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some
      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,
      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in
      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:&amp;mdash;The Authors of the
      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;
      LinnÃ¦us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
      Marten; LacÃ©pÃ¨de; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of
      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate
      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will
      show.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer
      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the
      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby
      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with
      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it
      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.
      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the
      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some
      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all
      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been
      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has
      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good
      people all,&amp;mdash;the Greenland whale is deposed,&amp;mdash;the great sperm
      whale now reigneth!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale&amp;rsquo;s and Bennett&amp;rsquo;s; both in
      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in
      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in
      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
      life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to
      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man
      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor
      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to
      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not
      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or&amp;mdash;in
      this place at least&amp;mdash;to much of any description. My object here is
      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
      architect, not the builder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to
      have one&amp;rsquo;s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis
      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to
      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well
      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the
      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through
      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in
      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is
      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still
      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,
      A.D. 1776, LinnÃ¦us declares, &amp;ldquo;I hereby separate the whales from the
      fish.&amp;rdquo; But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks
      and shad, alewives and herring, against LinnÃ¦us&amp;rsquo;s express edict, were
      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The grounds upon which LinnÃ¦us would fain have banished the whales from
      the waters, he states as follows: &amp;ldquo;On account of their warm bilocular
      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,&amp;rdquo; and finally, &amp;ldquo;ex lege naturÃ¦ jure
      meritoque.&amp;rdquo; I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they
      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This
      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect
      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, LinnÃ¦us has given you those
      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all
      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
      whale is &lt;i&gt;a spouting fish with a horizontal tail&lt;/i&gt;. There you have him.
      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.
      A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because
      he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more
      cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that
      all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or
      up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be
      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from
      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the
      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with
      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the
      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this
      ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire
      whale host.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included
      by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
      contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
      wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as
      whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom
      of Cetology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
      (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both
      small and large.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As the type of the FOLIO I present the &lt;i&gt;Sperm Whale&lt;/i&gt;; of the OCTAVO, the
      &lt;i&gt;Grampus&lt;/i&gt;; of the DUODECIMO, the &lt;i&gt;Porpoise&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:&amp;mdash;I. The
      &lt;i&gt;Sperm Whale&lt;/i&gt;; II. the &lt;i&gt;Right Whale&lt;/i&gt;; III. the &lt;i&gt;Fin-Back Whale&lt;/i&gt;; IV. the
      &lt;i&gt;Hump-backed Whale&lt;/i&gt;; V. the &lt;i&gt;Razor Back Whale&lt;/i&gt;; VI. the &lt;i&gt;Sulphur Bottom Whale&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER I. (&lt;i&gt;Sperm Whale&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;This whale, among the
      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,
      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the
      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,
      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of
      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far
      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that
      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,
      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I
      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries
      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper
      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the
      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly
      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known
      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that
      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale
      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,
      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but
      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the
      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in
      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its
      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its
      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the
      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from
      which this spermaceti was really derived.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER II. (&lt;i&gt;Right Whale&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;In one respect this is
      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
      the oil specially known as &amp;ldquo;whale oil,&amp;rdquo; an inferior article in commerce.
      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the
      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity
      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What
      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It
      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of
      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two
      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic
      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in
      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor&amp;rsquo; West Coast, and various
      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in
      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The
      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to
      elucidating the sperm whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER III. (&lt;i&gt;Fin-Back&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;Under this head I reckon a
      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in
      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three
      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of
      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the
      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,
      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is
      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this
      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it
      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat
      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that
      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He
      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going
      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most
      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power
      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this
      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing
      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his
      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a
      theoretic species denominated &lt;i&gt;Whalebone whales&lt;/i&gt;, that is, whales with
      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be
      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed
      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen&amp;rsquo;s names for a few sorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In connection with this appellative of &amp;ldquo;Whalebone whales,&amp;rdquo; it is of great
      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient
      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to
      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his
      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts
      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a
      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,
      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,
      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard
      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential
      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a
      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale
      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the
      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above
      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular
      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an
      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed
      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has
      split.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,
      in his anatomy&amp;mdash;there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right
      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland
      whale&amp;rsquo;s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by
      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And
      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you
      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the
      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?
      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal
      volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical
      system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for
      it alone is practicable. To proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;) CHAPTER IV. (&lt;i&gt;Hump Back&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;This whale is often seen on
      the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
      towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might
      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for
      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has
      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen.
      He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more
      gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER V. (&lt;i&gt;Razor Back&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;Of this whale little is
      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises
      in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does
      anybody else.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER VI. (&lt;i&gt;Sulphur Bottom&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;Another retiring
      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at
      least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then
      always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never
      chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of
      him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor
      can the oldest Nantucketer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus ends BOOK I. (&lt;i&gt;Folio&lt;/i&gt;), and now begins BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      OCTAVOES.*&amp;mdash;These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
      which present may be numbered:&amp;mdash;I., the &lt;i&gt;Grampus&lt;/i&gt;; II., the &lt;i&gt;Black Fish&lt;/i&gt;;
      III., the &lt;i&gt;Narwhale&lt;/i&gt;; IV., the &lt;i&gt;Thrasher&lt;/i&gt;; V., the &lt;i&gt;Killer&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the
      former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in
      figure, yet the bookbinder&amp;rsquo;s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does
      not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER I. (&lt;i&gt;Grampus&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;Though this fish, whose
      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly
      classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of
      the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of
      moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,
      and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is
      never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and
      pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as
      premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER II. (&lt;i&gt;Black Fish&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;I give the popular
      fishermen&amp;rsquo;s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because
      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena
      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
      swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment&amp;mdash;as
      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their
      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
      thirty gallons of oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER III. (&lt;i&gt;Narwhale&lt;/i&gt;), that is, &lt;i&gt;Nostril whale&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;mdash;Another
      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar
      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some
      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some
      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn
      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little
      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,
      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the
      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn
      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used
      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell
      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of
      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for
      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it
      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you
      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,
      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale&amp;mdash;however
      that may be&amp;mdash;it would certainly be very convenient to him for a
      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked
      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious
      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated
      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
      sea-unicorn&amp;rsquo;s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It
      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way
      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black
      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; &amp;ldquo;when Sir
      Martin returned from that voyage,&amp;rdquo; saith Black Letter, &amp;ldquo;on bended knees he
      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which
      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.&amp;rdquo; An Irish author
      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to
      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn
      nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His
      oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is
      seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER IV. (&lt;i&gt;Killer&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;Of this whale little is
      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that
      he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage&amp;mdash;a sort of
      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The
      Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception
      might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its
      indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and
      Sharks included.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER V. (&lt;i&gt;Thrasher&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;This gentleman is famous
      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts
      the Folio whale&amp;rsquo;s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging
      him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.
      Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws,
      even in the lawless seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
       Thus ends BOOK II. (&lt;i&gt;Octavo&lt;/i&gt;), and begins BOOK III. (&lt;i&gt;Duodecimo&lt;/i&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DUODECIMOES.&amp;mdash;These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza
      Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
      feet should be marshalled among WHALES&amp;mdash;a word, which, in the popular
      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition
      of what a whale is&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BOOK III. (&lt;i&gt;Duodecimo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER 1. (&lt;i&gt;Huzza Porpoise&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;This is the
      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims
      in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to
      heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally
      hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably
      come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always
      live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can
      withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help
      ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza
      Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and
      delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in
      request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.
      Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you
      that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
      you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.

      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke
      him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but
      never yet saw him captured.

      BOOK III. (&lt;i&gt;Duodecimo&lt;/i&gt;), CHAPTER III. (&lt;i&gt;Mealy-mouthed Porpoise&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;mdash;The
      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
      known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is
      that of the fishers&amp;mdash;Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
      he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in
      some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
      girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no
      fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and
      sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.
      Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a
      boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship&amp;rsquo;s hull, called the &amp;ldquo;bright
      waist,&amp;rdquo; that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate
      colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his
      head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
      escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy
      aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     * * * * * *
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans
      of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous
      whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not
      personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for
      possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may
      complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall
      hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into
      this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:&amp;mdash;The
      Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape
      Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered
      Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue
      Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there
      might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner
      of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly
      help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying
      nothing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here,
      and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my
      word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even
      as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing
      upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished
      by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone
      to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book
      is but a draught&amp;mdash;nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time,
      Strength, Cash, and Patience!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as
      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from
      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of
      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The large importance attached to the harpooneer&amp;rsquo;s vocation is evinced by
      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more
      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now
      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time
      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain&amp;rsquo;s
      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the
      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the
      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch
      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At
      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of
      the captain&amp;rsquo;s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a
      whaling ground) the command of the ship&amp;rsquo;s deck is also his; therefore the
      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live
      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as
      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
      as their social equal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this&amp;mdash;the
      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen
      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in
      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part
      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain&amp;rsquo;s cabin,
      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or
      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common
      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous
      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an
      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,
      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the
      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any
      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore
      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given
      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever
      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man
      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and
      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected
      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,
      whether of condescension or &lt;i&gt;in terrorem&lt;/i&gt;, or otherwise; yet even Captain
      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the
      sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those
      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
      dictatorship. For be a man&amp;rsquo;s intellectual superiority what it will, it can
      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without
      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps
      God&amp;rsquo;s true princes of the Empire from the world&amp;rsquo;s hustings; and leaves the
      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous
      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of
      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead
      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances
      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the
      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire
      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now
      alluded to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must
      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;
      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied
      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at
      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied
      air!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,
      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of
      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,
      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part
      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would
      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching
      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,
      unexhilarated voice, saying, &amp;ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,&amp;rdquo; disappears into the
      cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When the last echo of his sultan&amp;rsquo;s step has died away, and Starbuck, the
      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a
      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
      &amp;ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Stubb,&amp;rdquo; and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges
      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see
      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes
      up the old burden, and with a rapid &amp;ldquo;Dinner, Mr. Flask,&amp;rdquo; follows after his
      predecessors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts
      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he
      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the
      Grand Turk&amp;rsquo;s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up
      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as
      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by
      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway
      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,
      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab&amp;rsquo;s presence, in the character of
      Abjectus, or the Slave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some
      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly
      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers
      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander&amp;rsquo;s
      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and
      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is
      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?
      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been
      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have
      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and
      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited
      guests, that man&amp;rsquo;s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence
      for the time; that man&amp;rsquo;s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar&amp;rsquo;s, for
      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has
      tasted what it is to be CÃ¦sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which
      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the
      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive
      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on
      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential
      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were
      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk
      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all
      fastened upon the old man&amp;rsquo;s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.
      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment
      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the
      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the
      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s plate towards
      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it
      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the
      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these
      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at
      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a
      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the
      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his
      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would
      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the
      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask
      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the
      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny
      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,
      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is
      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask&amp;rsquo;s dinner was badly jammed in
      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they
      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but
      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon
      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,
      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy
      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask
      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of
      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much
      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,
      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;
      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the
      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There&amp;rsquo;s the fruits of
      promotion now; there&amp;rsquo;s the vanity of glory: there&amp;rsquo;s the insanity of life!
      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge
      against Flask in Flask&amp;rsquo;s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in
      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a
      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered
      before awful Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in
      the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order
      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to
      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers
      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a
      sort of temporary servants&amp;rsquo; hall of the high and mighty cabin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
      invisible domineerings of the captain&amp;rsquo;s table, was the entire care-free
      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.
      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the
      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain
      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the
      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a
      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy&amp;rsquo;s memory by
      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden
      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle
      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering
      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt
      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the
      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these
      three savages, Dough-Boy&amp;rsquo;s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.
      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they
      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry
      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,
      till all was over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his
      filed teeth to the Indian&amp;rsquo;s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the
      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.
      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say
      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small
      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or
      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,
      barbaric smack of the lip in eating&amp;mdash;an ugly sound enough&amp;mdash;so
      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the
      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances
      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would
      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all
      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white
      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,
      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three
      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering
      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish
      scimetars in scabbards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the
      ship&amp;rsquo;s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the
      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have
      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was
      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,
      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the
      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no
      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included
      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the
      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as
      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his
      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s soul, shut up in
      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
      other seamen my first mast-head came round.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously
      with the vessel&amp;rsquo;s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen
      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
      And if, after a three, four, or five years&amp;rsquo; voyage she is drawing nigh
      home with anything empty in her&amp;mdash;say, an empty vial even&amp;mdash;then,
      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles
      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the
      hope of capturing one whale more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take
      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;
      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their
      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have
      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet
      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may
      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath;
      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the
      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is
      an assertion based upon the general belief among archÃ¦ologists, that the
      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly
      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those
      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those
      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new
      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a
      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian
      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and
      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his
      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance
      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still
      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any
      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of
      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the
      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,
      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft
      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules&amp;rsquo; pillars,
      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London
      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick
      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers
      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is
      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of
      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early
      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit
      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the
      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this
      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,
      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from
      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of
      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy
      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the
      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic
      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the
      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of
      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite
      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;
      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have
      for dinner&amp;mdash;for all your meals for three years and more are snugly
      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years&amp;rsquo; voyage,
      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head
      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that
      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term
      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching
      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of
      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a
      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in
      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch
      is the head of the t&amp;rsquo; gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel
      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t&amp;rsquo; gallant cross-trees.
      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he
      would standing on a bull&amp;rsquo;s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may
      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but
      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the
      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and
      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running
      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps
      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere
      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest
      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
      your watch-coat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
      pulpits, called &lt;i&gt;crow&amp;rsquo;s-nests&lt;/i&gt;, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler
      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the
      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled &amp;ldquo;A Voyage among the
      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;&amp;rdquo; in this
      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
      &lt;i&gt;crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest&lt;/i&gt; of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet&amp;rsquo;s good
      craft. He called it the &lt;i&gt;Sleet&amp;rsquo;s crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest&lt;/i&gt;, in honor of himself; he
      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own
      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise
      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In
      shape, the Sleet&amp;rsquo;s crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;
      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable
      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed
      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch
      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a
      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and
      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,
      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in
      person stood his mast-head in this crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest of his, he tells us that he
      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a
      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,
      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was
      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
      little detailed conveniences of his crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest; but though he so enlarges
      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account
      of his experiments in this crow&amp;rsquo;s-nest, with a small compass he kept there
      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
      the &amp;ldquo;local attraction&amp;rdquo; of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the
      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship&amp;rsquo;s planks, and in the Glacier&amp;rsquo;s
      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among
      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific
      here, yet, for all his learned &amp;ldquo;binnacle deviations,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;azimuth compass
      observations,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;approximate errors,&amp;rdquo; he knows very well, Captain
      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well
      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his
      crow&amp;rsquo;s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I
      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;
      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that
      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have
      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the
      mathematics aloft there in that bird&amp;rsquo;s nest within three or four perches
      of the pole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain
      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly
      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive
      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up
      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with
      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending
      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take
      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my
      ultimate destination.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but
      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I&amp;mdash;being
      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude&amp;mdash;how
      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships&amp;rsquo; 
      standing orders, &amp;ldquo;Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
      offers to ship with the PhÃ¦don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of
      such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be killed;
      and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the
      world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these
      monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an
      asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,
      disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar
      and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the
      mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase
      ejaculates:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!
      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
      &amp;ldquo;interest&amp;rdquo; in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to
      all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather
      not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists
      have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what
      use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses
      at home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, thou monkey,&amp;rdquo; said a harpooneer to one of these lads, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve been
      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.
      Whales are scarce as hen&amp;rsquo;s teeth whenever thou art up here.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps they
      were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;
      but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious
      reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with
      thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at
      his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,
      pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,
      beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of
      some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
      thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In
      this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes
      diffused through time and space; like Cranmer&amp;rsquo;s sprinkled Pantheistic
      ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the
      inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move
      your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes
      back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at
      mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop
      through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for
      ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;Enter Ahab: Then, all.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway
      to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country
      gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you
      would see still stranger foot-prints&amp;mdash;the foot-prints of his one
      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought
      was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast
      and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as
      he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,
      indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rsquo;ye mark him, Flask?&amp;rdquo; whispered Stubb; &amp;ldquo;the chick that&amp;rsquo;s in him pecks
      the shell. &amp;rsquo;Twill soon be out.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The hours wore on;&amp;mdash;Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
      the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks,
      and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand
      grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir!&amp;rdquo; said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Send everybody aft,&amp;rdquo; repeated Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Mast-heads, there! come down!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When the entire ship&amp;rsquo;s company were assembled, and with curious and not
      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the
      weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing
      over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from
      his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy
      turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to
      pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb
      cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for
      the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.
      Vehemently pausing, he cried:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sing out for him!&amp;rdquo; was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
      voices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
      thrown them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And what do ye next, men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lower away, and after him!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And what tune is it ye pull to, men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A dead whale or a stove boat!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
      convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
      whale. Look ye! d&amp;rsquo;ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;holding up a
      broad bright coin to the sun&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.
      D&amp;rsquo;ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly
      rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten
      its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to
      himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it
      seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,
      and with a high raised voice exclaiming: &amp;ldquo;Whosoever of ye raises me a
      white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye
      raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his
      starboard fluke&amp;mdash;look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white
      whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Huzza! huzza!&amp;rdquo; cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed
      the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a white whale, I say,&amp;rdquo; resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
      &amp;ldquo;a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
      if ye see but a bubble, sing out.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more
      intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the
      wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately
      touched by some specific recollection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab,&amp;rdquo; said Tashtego, &amp;ldquo;that white whale must be the same that
      some call Moby Dick.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Moby Dick?&amp;rdquo; shouted Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?&amp;rdquo; said the
      Gay-Header deliberately.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And has he a curious spout, too,&amp;rdquo; said Daggoo, &amp;ldquo;very bushy, even for a
      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And he have one, two, three&amp;mdash;oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
      Captain,&amp;rdquo; cried Queequeg disjointedly, &amp;ldquo;all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him&amp;mdash;him&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
       faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though
      uncorking a bottle&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;like him&amp;mdash;him&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Corkscrew!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, &amp;ldquo;aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and
      wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock
      of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual
      sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a
      squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen&amp;mdash;Moby
      Dick&amp;mdash;Moby Dick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. &amp;ldquo;Captain
      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick&amp;mdash;but it was not Moby Dick that took
      off thy leg?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who told thee that?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab; then pausing, &amp;ldquo;Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,&amp;rdquo; he shouted with a
      terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; &amp;ldquo;Aye,
      aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging
      lubber of me for ever and a day!&amp;rdquo; Then tossing both arms, with measureless
      imprecations he shouted out: &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye! and I&amp;rsquo;ll chase him round Good
      Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round
      perdition&amp;rsquo;s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped
      for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all
      sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye,
      men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye!&amp;rdquo; shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
      excited old man: &amp;ldquo;A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby
      Dick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;God bless ye,&amp;rdquo; he seemed to half sob and half shout. &amp;ldquo;God bless ye, men.
      Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what&amp;rsquo;s this long face
      about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for
      Moby Dick?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came
      here to hunt whales, not my commander&amp;rsquo;s vengeance. How many barrels will
      thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will
      not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
      little lower layer. If money&amp;rsquo;s to be the measurer, man, and the
      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
      me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium &lt;i&gt;here!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He smites his chest,&amp;rdquo; whispered Stubb, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s that for? methinks it
      rings most vast, but hollow.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Vengeance on a dumb brute!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;that simply smote thee from
      blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,
      seems blasphemous.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hark ye yet again&amp;mdash;the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event&amp;mdash;in the living act,
      the undoubted deed&amp;mdash;there, some unknown but still reasoning thing
      puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.
      If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there&amp;rsquo;s naught beyond. But
      &amp;rsquo;tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
      with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly
      what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
      principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,
      man; I&amp;rsquo;d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then
      could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein,
      jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even
      that fair play. Who&amp;rsquo;s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye!
      more intolerable than fiends&amp;rsquo; glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou
      reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,
      Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men
      from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let
      it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn&amp;mdash;living,
      breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards&amp;mdash;the
      unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no
      reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they
      not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he
      laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the
      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?
      Reckon it. &amp;rsquo;Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.
      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all
      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has
      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow
      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!&amp;mdash;Aye, aye! thy silence, then, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;
      voices thee. (&lt;i&gt;Aside&lt;/i&gt;) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has
      inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now,
      without rebellion.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;God keep me!&amp;mdash;keep us all!&amp;rdquo; murmured Starbuck, lowly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did
      not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold;
      nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the
      hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts
      sank in. For again Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s downcast eyes lighted up with the
      stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;
      the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye
      admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye
      predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from
      without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little
      external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these
      still drive us on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The measure! the measure!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered
      them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the
      capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood
      at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship&amp;rsquo;s company formed a
      circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every
      man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the
      prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their
      head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden
      snare of the Indian.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Drink and pass!&amp;rdquo; he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
      nearest seaman. &amp;ldquo;The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
      draughts&amp;mdash;long swallows, men; &amp;rsquo;tis hot as Satan&amp;rsquo;s hoof. So, so; it
      goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
      way it comes. Hand it me&amp;mdash;here&amp;rsquo;s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye
      mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with
      your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort
      revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will
      yet see that&amp;mdash;Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand
      it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer&amp;rsquo;t not thou St.
      Vitus&amp;rsquo; imp&amp;mdash;away, thou ague!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
      touch the axis.&amp;rdquo; So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,
      radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and
      nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to
      Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,
      interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery
      emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The
      three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb
      and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell
      downright.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In vain!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab; &amp;ldquo;but, maybe, &amp;rsquo;tis well. For did ye three but once
      take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; had perhaps
      expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
      Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye
      three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there&amp;mdash;yon three most
      honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the
      task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his
      tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; shall
      bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw
      the poles, ye harpooneers!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
      up, before him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not
      the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.
      The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!&amp;rdquo; Forthwith, slowly going
      from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the
      fiery waters from the pewter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
      whaleboat&amp;rsquo;s bow&amp;mdash;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not
      hunt Moby Dick to his death!&amp;rdquo; The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
      and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
      simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and
      shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
      among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
      dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.

      CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where&amp;rsquo;er I
      sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but
      first I pass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet&amp;rsquo;s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The
      gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun&amp;mdash;slow dived from noon&amp;mdash;goes
      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the
      crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright
      with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel
      that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. &amp;rsquo;Tis iron&amp;mdash;that I know&amp;mdash;not
      gold. &amp;rsquo;Tis split, too&amp;mdash;that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my
      brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the
      sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me,
      so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all
      loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne&amp;rsquo;er enjoy. Gifted with the high
      perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most
      malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night&amp;mdash;good night!
      (&lt;i&gt;waving his hand, he moves from the window&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;rsquo;Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand
      before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match
      itself must needs be wasting! What I&amp;rsquo;ve dared, I&amp;rsquo;ve willed; and what I&amp;rsquo;ve
      willed, I&amp;rsquo;ll do! They think me mad&amp;mdash;Starbuck does; but I&amp;rsquo;m demoniac,
      I am madness maddened! That wild madness that&amp;rsquo;s only calm to comprehend
      itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and&amp;mdash;Aye! I
      lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now,
      then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That&amp;rsquo;s more than ye, ye great
      gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
      ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to
      bullies&amp;mdash;Take some one of your own size; don&amp;rsquo;t pommel &lt;i&gt;me!&lt;/i&gt; No, ye&amp;rsquo;ve
      knocked me down, and I am up again; but &lt;i&gt;ye&lt;/i&gt; have run and hidden. Come forth
      from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s
      compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot
      swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The
      path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is
      grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of
      mountains, under torrents&amp;rsquo; beds, unerringly I rush! Naught&amp;rsquo;s an obstacle,
      naught&amp;rsquo;s an angle to the iron way!

      &lt;i&gt;By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      My soul is more than matched; she&amp;rsquo;s overmanned; and by a madman!
      Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he
      drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his
      impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the
      ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife
      to cut. Horrible old man! Who&amp;rsquo;s over him, he cries;&amp;mdash;aye, he would be
      a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
      plainly see my miserable office,&amp;mdash;to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
      to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would
      shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The
      hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish
      has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I
      would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock&amp;rsquo;s run down; my
      heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      [&lt;i&gt;A burst of revelry from the forecastle&lt;/i&gt;.]
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
      mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is
      their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark
      the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through
      the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to
      drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin,
      builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its
      wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers,
      and set the watch! Oh, life! &amp;rsquo;tis in an hour like this, with soul beat
      down and held to knowledge,&amp;mdash;as wild, untutored things are forced to
      feed&amp;mdash;Oh, life! &amp;rsquo;tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee!
      but &amp;rsquo;tis not me! that horror&amp;rsquo;s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the
      human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand
      by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking over it
      ever since, and that ha, ha&amp;rsquo;s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
      laugh&amp;rsquo;s the wisest, easiest answer to all that&amp;rsquo;s queer; and come what
      will, one comfort&amp;rsquo;s always left&amp;mdash;that unfailing comfort is, it&amp;rsquo;s all
      predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
      Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the
      old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,
      might readily have prophesied it&amp;mdash;for when I clapped my eye upon his
      skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, &lt;i&gt;wise&lt;/i&gt; Stubb&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s my title&amp;mdash;well,
      Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here&amp;rsquo;s a carcase. I know not all that may be
      coming, but be it what it will, I&amp;rsquo;ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
      leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
      skirra! What&amp;rsquo;s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
      out?&amp;mdash;Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay
      as a frigate&amp;rsquo;s pennant, and so am I&amp;mdash;fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
      We&amp;rsquo;ll drink to-night with hearts as light,
         To love, as gay and fleeting
      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker&amp;rsquo;s brim,
         And break on the lips while meeting.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      A brave stave that&amp;mdash;who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir&amp;mdash;(&lt;i&gt;Aside&lt;/i&gt;)
      he&amp;rsquo;s my superior, he has his too, if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken.&amp;mdash;Aye, aye,

&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don&amp;rsquo;t be sentimental; it&amp;rsquo;s bad
      for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    Our captain stood upon the deck,
    A spy-glass in his hand,
    A viewing of those gallant whales
    That blew at every strand.
    Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
    And by your braces stand,
    And we&amp;rsquo;ll have one of those fine whales,
    Hand, boys, over hand!
    So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
    While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

      MATE&amp;rsquo;S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d&amp;rsquo;ye hear,
      bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call
      the watch. I&amp;rsquo;ve the sort of mouth for that&amp;mdash;the hogshead mouth. So,
      so, (&lt;i&gt;thrusts his head down the scuttle&lt;/i&gt;,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight
      bells there below! Tumble up!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
      this in our old Mogul&amp;rsquo;s wine; it&amp;rsquo;s quite as deadening to some as filliping
      to others. We sing; they sleep&amp;mdash;aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
      butts. At &amp;rsquo;em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail &amp;rsquo;em through
      it. Tell &amp;rsquo;em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell &amp;rsquo;em it&amp;rsquo;s the
      resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That&amp;rsquo;s the
      way&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/i&gt; it; thy throat ain&amp;rsquo;t spoiled with eating Amsterdam
      butter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let&amp;rsquo;s have a jig or two before we ride to
      anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by
      all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      PIP. (&lt;i&gt;Sulky and sleepy.&lt;/i&gt;) Don&amp;rsquo;t know where it is.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say;
      merry&amp;rsquo;s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won&amp;rsquo;t you dance? Form, now,
      Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs!
      legs!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      ICELAND SAILOR. I don&amp;rsquo;t like your floor, maty; it&amp;rsquo;s too springy to my
      taste. I&amp;rsquo;m used to ice-floors. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to throw cold water on the
      subject; but excuse me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where&amp;rsquo;s your girls? Who but a fool would take his
      left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d&amp;rsquo;ye do? Partners! I must
      have partners!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!&amp;mdash;then I&amp;rsquo;ll hop with ye; yea,
      turn grasshopper!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty more of us. Hoe
      corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the
      music; now for it!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      AZORE SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle&lt;/i&gt;.)
      Here you are, Pip; and there&amp;rsquo;s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,
      boys! (&lt;i&gt;The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep
      or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      AZORE SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Dancing&lt;/i&gt;) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it,
      stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      PIP. Jinglers, you say?&amp;mdash;there goes another, dropped off; I pound it
      so.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
      thyself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!
      Split jibs! tear yourselves!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      TASHTEGO. (&lt;i&gt;Quietly smoking.&lt;/i&gt;) That&amp;rsquo;s a white man; he calls that fun: humph!
      I save my sweat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
      they are dancing over. I&amp;rsquo;ll dance over your grave, I will&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s the
      bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.
      O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well,
      well; belike the whole world&amp;rsquo;s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so
      &amp;rsquo;tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you&amp;rsquo;re young; I was
      once.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!&amp;mdash;whew! this is worse than pulling
      after whales in a calm&amp;mdash;give us a whiff, Tash.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens&amp;mdash;the
      wind rises&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it&amp;rsquo;ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
      high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      MALTESE SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Reclining and shaking his cap&lt;/i&gt;.) It&amp;rsquo;s the waves&amp;mdash;the
      snow&amp;rsquo;s caps turn to jig it now. They&amp;rsquo;ll shake their tassels soon. Now
      would all the waves were women, then I&amp;rsquo;d go drown, and chassee with them
      evermore! There&amp;rsquo;s naught so sweet on earth&amp;mdash;heaven may not match it!&amp;mdash;as
      those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
      over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SICILIAN SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Reclining&lt;/i&gt;.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad&amp;mdash;fleet
      interlacings of the limbs&amp;mdash;lithe swayings&amp;mdash;coyings&amp;mdash;flutterings!
      lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
      else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (&lt;i&gt;Nudging&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      TAHITAN SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Reclining on a mat&lt;/i&gt;.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing
      girls!&amp;mdash;the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still
      rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the
      wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted
      quite. Ah me!&amp;mdash;not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be
      transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee&amp;rsquo;s peak
      of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?&amp;mdash;The
      blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (&lt;i&gt;Leaps to his feet&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing &amp;rsquo;gainst the side! Stand by
      for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
      they&amp;rsquo;ll go lunging presently.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
      holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He&amp;rsquo;s no more
      afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
      storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
      tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
      waterspout with a pistol&amp;mdash;fire your ship right into it!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man&amp;rsquo;s a grand old cove! We are the
      lads to hunt him up his whale!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      ALL. Aye! aye!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of
      tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there&amp;rsquo;s none but the
      crew&amp;rsquo;s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather
      when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain
      has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there&amp;rsquo;s another in the sky&amp;mdash;lurid-like,
      ye see, all else pitch black.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DAGGOO. What of that? Who&amp;rsquo;s afraid of black&amp;rsquo;s afraid of me! I&amp;rsquo;m quarried
      out of it!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      SPANISH SAILOR. (&lt;i&gt;Aside&lt;/i&gt;.) He wants to bully, ah!&amp;mdash;the old grudge makes
      me touchy (&lt;i&gt;Advancing&lt;/i&gt;.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark
      side of mankind&amp;mdash;devilish dark at that. No offence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      DAGGOO (&lt;i&gt;grimly&lt;/i&gt;). None.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      ST. JAGO&amp;rsquo;S SAILOR. That Spaniard&amp;rsquo;s mad or drunk. But that can&amp;rsquo;t be, or
      else in his one case our old Mogul&amp;rsquo;s fire-waters are somewhat long in
      working.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

      TASHTEGO (&lt;i&gt;with a whiff&lt;/i&gt;). A row a&amp;rsquo;low, and a row aloft&amp;mdash;Gods and men&amp;mdash;both
      brawlers! Humph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge
      in with ye!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard&amp;rsquo;s knife! A ring, a ring!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
      Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad&amp;rsquo;st thou
      the ring?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

      PIP (&lt;i&gt;shrinking under the windlass&lt;/i&gt;). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!

      here comes the royal yard! It&amp;rsquo;s worse than being in the whirled woods, the
      last day of the year! Who&amp;rsquo;d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there
      they go, all cursing, and here I don&amp;rsquo;t. Fine prospects to &amp;rsquo;em; they&amp;rsquo;re on
      the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps
      there are worse yet&amp;mdash;they are your white squalls, they. White
      squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just
      now, and the white whale&amp;mdash;shirr! shirr!&amp;mdash;but spoken of once! and
      only this evening&amp;mdash;it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine&amp;mdash;that
      anaconda of an old man swore &amp;rsquo;em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God
      aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy
      down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!

      CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
      oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
      hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild,
      mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab&amp;rsquo;s quenchless feud seemed
      mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster
      against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and
      revenge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
      White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
      Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who
      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they
      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them
      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom
      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a
      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all
      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the
      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,
      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,
      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and
      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I
      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.
      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not
      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the
      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale
      had hitherto been popularly regarded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
      assaults&amp;mdash;not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
      or devouring amputations&amp;mdash;but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their
      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude
      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually
      come.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
      terrible events,&amp;mdash;as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,
      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And
      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness
      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the
      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly
      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest
      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand
      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by
      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty
      birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the
      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
      half-formed fÅtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually
      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly
      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that
      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of
      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,
      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died
      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among
      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to
      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps&amp;mdash;either from professional
      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the
      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among
      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never
      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the
      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the
      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere
      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists&amp;mdash;Olassen
      and Povelson&amp;mdash;declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a
      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
      even down to so late a time as Cuvier&amp;rsquo;s, were these or almost similar
      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms
      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are &amp;ldquo;struck
      with the most lively terrors,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;often in the precipitancy of their
      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
      instantaneous death.&amp;rdquo; And however the general experiences in the fishery
      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to
      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in
      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the
      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised
      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;
      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully
      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm
      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to
      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable
      documents that may be consulted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing
      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of
      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were
      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the
      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most
      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the
      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from
      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory
      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes
      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as
      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that
      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies
      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is
      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared
      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded
      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some
      whalemen, that the Nor&amp;rsquo; West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never
      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of
      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more
      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were
      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these
      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
      whalemen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;
      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still
      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,
      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away
      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a
      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows
      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the
      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was
      elsewhere thrown out&amp;mdash;a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a
      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the
      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his
      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his
      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
      gleamings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent
      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,
      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or
      drive them back in consternation to their ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the
      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s infernal
      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,
      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent
      agent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his
      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,
      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds
      of the whale&amp;rsquo;s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that
      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That
      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab&amp;rsquo;s leg,
      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired
      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all
      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the
      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men
      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;
      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the
      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue
      devil;&amp;mdash;Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but
      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted
      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;
      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all
      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of
      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale&amp;rsquo;s white
      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot
      heart&amp;rsquo;s shell upon it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the
      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,
      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal
      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but
      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this
      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and
      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in
      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his
      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made
      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the
      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from
      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his
      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in
      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the
      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with
      mild stun&amp;rsquo;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all
      appearances, the old man&amp;rsquo;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape
      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light
      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved
      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you
      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
      form. Ahab&amp;rsquo;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like
      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but
      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing
      monomania, not one jot of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s broad madness had been left behind; so in
      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had
      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If
      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general
      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own
      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one
      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely
      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is much; yet Ahab&amp;rsquo;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But
      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far
      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we
      here stand&amp;mdash;however grand and wonderful, now quit it;&amp;mdash;and take
      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&amp;rsquo;s upper earth, his root of
      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried
      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the
      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,
      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down
      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family
      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your
      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,
      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;
      in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only
      subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,
      so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he
      stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but
      naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which
      had overtaken him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present
      voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far
      from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of
      such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were
      inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the
      better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
      wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,
      with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
      could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his
      lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
      thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would
      seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
      attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret
      of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
      upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of
      hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but
      half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast
      and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They
      were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars
      from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and
      supernatural revenge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
      Job&amp;rsquo;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up
      of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals&amp;mdash;morally enfeebled
      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
      seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
      to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
      to the old man&amp;rsquo;s ire&amp;mdash;by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
      that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their
      insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be&amp;mdash;what the White
      Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
      some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of
      the seas of life,&amp;mdash;all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
      Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
      tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
      pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a
      seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment
      of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the
      whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.

      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was
      to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
      could not but occasionally awaken in any man&amp;rsquo;s soul some alarm, there was
      another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at
      times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so
      mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting
      it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above
      all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and
      yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these
      chapters might be naught.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
      if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and
      pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain
      royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu
      placing the title &amp;ldquo;Lord of the White Elephants&amp;rdquo; above all their other
      magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam
      unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the
      Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the
      great Austrian Empire, CÃ¦sarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the
      imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it
      applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership
      over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
      even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
      marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
      symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble
      things&amp;mdash;the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
      the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the
      deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the
      majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the
      daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in
      the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the
      symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire
      worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;
      and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a
      snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice
      of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
      that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could
      send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity;
      and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the
      redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the
      great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;
      yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
      honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
      innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than
      that redness which affrights in blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
      what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors
      they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent
      mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their
      aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so
      stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,
      separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that
      brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only
      rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the
      creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;
      and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,
      the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even
      assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you
      would not have that intensified terror.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit
      by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for
      the dead begins with &amp;ldquo;Requiem eternam&amp;rdquo; (eternal rest), whence &lt;i&gt;Requiem&lt;/i&gt;
      denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in
      allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the
      mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him &lt;i&gt;Requin&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God&amp;rsquo;s great,
      unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main
      hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a
      hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast
      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and
      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some
      king&amp;rsquo;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange
      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham
      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings
      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable
      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy
      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through
      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was
      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it
      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!
      never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman&amp;rsquo;s name
      for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge&amp;rsquo;s wild Rhyme have
      had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I
      saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor
      knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly
      burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly
      lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a
      solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I
      have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the
      Antarctic fowl.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;
      with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last
      the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round
      its neck, with the ship&amp;rsquo;s time and place; and then letting it escape. But
      I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,
      when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and
      adoring cherubim!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,
      small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs
      in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast
      herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the
      Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward
      trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of
      light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail,
      invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters
      could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of
      that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and
      hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked
      majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether
      marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that
      endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed
      gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool
      milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest
      Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be
      questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that
      it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with
      divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
      commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
      Albatross.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears.
      The Albino is as well made as other men&amp;mdash;has no substantive deformity&amp;mdash;and
      yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely
      hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the
      less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning
      attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of
      the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some
      historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an
      auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in
      Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the
      desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind
      fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be
      doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most
      appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that
      pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as
      of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow
      the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our
      superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our
      phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog&amp;mdash;Yea, while these
      terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when
      personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing
      he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized
      significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the
      citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness&amp;mdash;though
      for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct
      associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,
      is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;&amp;mdash;can we
      thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause
      we seek?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and
      without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to
      be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
      recall them now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
      of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
      processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen
      snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American
      States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,
      evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings
      (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of
      London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled
      American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors&amp;mdash;the
      Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White
      Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic
      ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the
      thought of Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant
      dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the
      name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that
      of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild
      afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of
      sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed
      to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does
      &amp;ldquo;the tall pale man&amp;rdquo; of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor
      unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves&amp;mdash;why is this
      phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness
      of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning
      spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of
      anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon
      each other, as a tossed pack of cards;&amp;mdash;it is not these things alone
      which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can&amp;rsquo;st see. For
      Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this
      whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for
      ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads
      over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its
      own distortions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is
      not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects
      otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror
      in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely
      consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form
      at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two
      statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following
      examples.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
      night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
      enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
      similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship
      sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness&amp;mdash;as if from
      encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,
      then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the
      whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead
      assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down;
      he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the
      mariner who will tell thee, &amp;ldquo;Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking
      hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere
      fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to
      break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
      scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of
      legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
      shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
      views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
      ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a
      white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
      Ishmael.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey&amp;mdash;why is it that upon the
      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he
      cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness&amp;mdash;why
      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
      of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
      creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
      smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
      former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
      bisons of distant Oregon?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
      herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
      this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed
      snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that
      buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world
      seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned
      why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more
      portentous&amp;mdash;why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning
      symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian&amp;rsquo;s Deity;
      and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most
      appalling to mankind.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and
      immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?
      Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the
      visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full
      of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows&amp;mdash;a colourless, all-colour of
      atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of
      the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues&amp;mdash;every stately
      or lovely emblazoning&amp;mdash;the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;
      yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in
      substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature
      absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
      charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the
      mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
      principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if
      operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips
      and roses, with its own blank tinge&amp;mdash;pondering all this, the palsied
      universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
      who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the
      wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that
      wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino
      whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 43. Hark!
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
      cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
      scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
      fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
      precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
      their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
      only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
      unceasingly advancing keel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
      post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
      words above.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d&amp;rsquo;ye mean?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There it is again&amp;mdash;under the hatches&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t you hear it&amp;mdash;a
      cough&amp;mdash;it sounded like a cough.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There again&amp;mdash;there it is!&amp;mdash;it sounds like two or three sleepers
      turning over, now!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It&amp;rsquo;s the three soaked biscuits ye
      eat for supper turning over inside of ye&amp;mdash;nothing else. Look to the
      bucket!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Say what ye will, shipmate; I&amp;rsquo;ve sharp ears.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, you are the chap, ain&amp;rsquo;t ye, that heard the hum of the old
      Quakeress&amp;rsquo;s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you&amp;rsquo;re the
      chap.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Grin away; we&amp;rsquo;ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
      down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
      our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
      morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Tish! the bucket!&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
      with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and
      bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them
      before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you
      would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which
      there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional
      courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer
      to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
      and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm
      whales had been captured or seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
      shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
      almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on
      the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
      courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others
      were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab
      was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
      certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it
      might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to
      Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating
      the driftings of the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s food; and, also, calling to mind the
      regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
      could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,
      concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of
      his prey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
      whale&amp;rsquo;s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could
      he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for
      one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the
      migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
      invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
      On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
      charts of the sperm whale.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of
     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
     the circular. &amp;ldquo;This chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.&amp;rdquo;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct&amp;mdash;say, rather, secret
      intelligence from the Deity&amp;mdash;mostly swim in &lt;i&gt;veins&lt;/i&gt;, as they are
      called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
      undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,
      with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor&amp;rsquo;s parallel, and
      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
      straight wake, yet the arbitrary &lt;i&gt;vein&lt;/i&gt; in which at these times he is said
      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
      sweep from the whale-ship&amp;rsquo;s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along
      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that
      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be
      looked for.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
      without prospect of a meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.
      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for
      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds
      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will
      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the
      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances
      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,
      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former
      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the
      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,
      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,
      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to
      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab&amp;rsquo;s chances of
      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only
      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would
      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were
      conjoined in the one technical phrase&amp;mdash;the Season-on-the-Line. For
      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of
      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the
      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;
      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the
      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and
      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this
      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon
      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to
      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to
      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the
      premature hour of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly
      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,
      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before
      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would
      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his
      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should
      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or
      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,
      Pampas, Nor&amp;rsquo;-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and
      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
      Pequod&amp;rsquo;s circumnavigating wake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged
      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of
      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And
      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after
      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself
      back in reveries&amp;mdash;tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins
      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep&amp;rsquo;s ear! And here, his mad
      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to
      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps
      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the
      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round
      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his
      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the
      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and
      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings
      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when
      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as
      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead
      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at
      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at
      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the
      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent
      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the
      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it
      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s case, yielding up
      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by
      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils
      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could
      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,
      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab
      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless
      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old
      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for
      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.

      CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
      indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in
      the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is
      as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter
      of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in
      order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any
      incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in
      some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,
      practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
      citations, I take it&amp;mdash;the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow
      of itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private
      cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years
      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may
      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in
      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common
      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,
      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it
      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the
      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came
      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales
      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective
      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and
      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole
      under the whale&amp;rsquo;s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I
      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have
      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter
      there is no good ground to impeach.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in
      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of
      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a
      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen
      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
      celebrity&amp;mdash;Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but
      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a
      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or CÃ¦sar. Was it not so, O
      Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
      did&amp;rsquo;st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen
      from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou
      terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the
      Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they
      say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
      Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
      tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are
      four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
      Sylla to the classic scholar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by
      valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express
      object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,
      Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious
      murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole
      story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one
      of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much
      bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest
      and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching
      the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
      scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more
      detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One
      reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
      deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
      however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
      that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
      whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
      bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan&amp;mdash;do you suppose that that
      poor fellow&amp;rsquo;s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
      to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
      between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
      called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
      that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
      others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death
      by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
      boat&amp;rsquo;s crew. For God&amp;rsquo;s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!
      not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man&amp;rsquo;s blood was spilled
      for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
      an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
      narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
      they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
      declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
      when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
      sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; done it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
      cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,
      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales
      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his
      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than &amp;ldquo;ten
      minutes&amp;rdquo; she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has
      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the
      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once
      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never
      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.
      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the
      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed
      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
      catastrophe.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The following are extracts from Chace&amp;rsquo;s narrative: &amp;ldquo;Every fact seemed to
      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed
      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short
      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were
      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby
      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the
      exact manÅuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most
      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from
      the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck
      three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.&amp;rdquo;
       Again: &amp;ldquo;At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all
      happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in
      my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
      of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that
      I am correct in my opinion.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black
      night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable
      shore. &amp;ldquo;The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of
      being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,
      with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed
      scarcely entitled to a moment&amp;rsquo;s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and &lt;i&gt;the
      horrid aspect and revenge of the whale&lt;/i&gt;, wholly engrossed my reflections,
      until day again made its appearance.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In another place&amp;mdash;p. 45,&amp;mdash;he speaks of &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;the mysterious and
      mortal attack of the animal&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally
      lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of
      this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale
      hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;, then
      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
      harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the
      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is
      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable
      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm
      whale, that begged a few moments&amp;rsquo; confidential business with him. That
      business consisted in fetching the Commodore&amp;rsquo;s craft such a thwack, that
      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave
      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore&amp;rsquo;s
      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale
      will stand no nonsense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I will now refer you to Langsdorff&amp;rsquo;s Voyages for a little circumstance in
      point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must
      know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern&amp;rsquo;s famous
      Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain
      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon
      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost
      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board
      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon
      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We
      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.
      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost
      gravity and solemnity. Captain D&amp;rsquo;Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to
      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the Captain D&amp;rsquo;Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures
      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near
      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly
      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates
      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian
      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after
      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
      of honest wonders&amp;mdash;the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
      Dampier&amp;rsquo;s old chums&amp;mdash;I found a little matter set down so like that
      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
      corroborative example, if such be needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to &amp;ldquo;John Ferdinando,&amp;rdquo; as he calls the
      modern Juan Fernandes. &amp;ldquo;In our way thither,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;about four o&amp;rsquo;clock
      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such
      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to
      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock
      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck
      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the
      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock
      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken
      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was
      thrown out of his cabin!&amp;rdquo; Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a
      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused
      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me
      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running
      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured
      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks
      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often
      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and
      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I
      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a
      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,
      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by
      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)
      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
      amen with Solomon&amp;mdash;Verily there is nothing new under the sun.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every
      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some
      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be
      mentioned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact
      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is
      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster
      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other
      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a
      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the
      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep
      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place
      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am
      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of
      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of
      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by
      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
      called &lt;i&gt;brit&lt;/i&gt; is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale&amp;mdash;squid or
      cuttle-fish&amp;mdash;lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large
      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at
      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
      human reasoning, Procopius&amp;rsquo;s sea-monster, that for half a century stove
      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
      whale.

      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
      though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
      passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
      habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman&amp;rsquo;s ways, altogether to
      abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were
      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might
      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that
      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances
      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one
      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of
      swaying him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for
      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any
      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for
      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal
      relation. Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s body and Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s coerced will were Ahab&amp;rsquo;s, so long
      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s brain; still he knew that for all
      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain&amp;rsquo;s quest, and could
      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It
      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.
      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open
      relapses of rebellion against his captain&amp;rsquo;s leadership, unless some
      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick
      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and
      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some
      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally
      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn
      into the obscure background (for few men&amp;rsquo;s courage is proof against
      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their
      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage
      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all
      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable&amp;mdash;they live in the
      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness&amp;mdash;and when
      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and
      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for
      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric
      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of
      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they
      been strictly held to their one final and romantic object&amp;mdash;that final
      and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will
      not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash&amp;mdash;aye, cash.
      They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective
      promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once
      mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
      Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat
      prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s voyage,
      Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid
      himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect
      impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end
      competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently
      wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of
      usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression
      gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect
      himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
      and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
      every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to
      be subjected to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
      developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
      continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s voyage;
      observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to
      evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of
      his profession.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about
      the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg
      and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an
      additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow
      preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in
      the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible
      self.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept
      passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long
      yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg,
      standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the
      threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly
      drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign
      all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting
      dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time,
      and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the
      Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,
      ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to
      admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This
      warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
      shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage&amp;rsquo;s sword,
      thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this
      easy, indifferent sword must be chance&amp;mdash;aye, chance, free will, and
      necessity&amp;mdash;nowise incompatible&amp;mdash;all interweavingly working
      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
      ultimate course&amp;mdash;its every alternating vibration, indeed, only
      tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given
      threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
      of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last
      featuring blow at events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence
      that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad
      Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand
      stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his
      cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard
      all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen&amp;rsquo;s look-outs perched as high
      in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have
      derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly
      peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or
      seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing
      their coming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Where-away?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Instantly all was commotion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other
      tribes of his genus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There go flukes!&amp;rdquo; was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
      disappeared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Quick, steward!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Time! time!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
      minute to Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
      opposite quarter&amp;mdash;this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego
      had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
      the men selected for shipkeepers&amp;mdash;that is, those not appointed to the
      boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors
      at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their
      places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
      boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
      Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,
      while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long
      line of man-of-war&amp;rsquo;s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy&amp;rsquo;s
      ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a name=&#34;link2HCH0048&#34; id=&#34;link2HCH0048&#34;&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of
      the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles
      and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed
      one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain&amp;rsquo;s, on
      account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now
      stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly
      protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black
      cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark
      stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited
      turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.
      Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
      tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the
      Manillas;&amp;mdash;a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and
      by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret
      confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose
      counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While yet the wondering ship&amp;rsquo;s company were gazing upon these strangers,
      Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, &amp;ldquo;All ready
      there, Fedallah?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ready,&amp;rdquo; was the half-hissed reply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lower away then; d&amp;rsquo;ye hear?&amp;rdquo; shouting across the deck. &amp;ldquo;Lower away there,
      I say.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
      sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
      wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
      off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like,
      leaped down the rolling ship&amp;rsquo;s side into the tossed boats below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship&amp;rsquo;s lee, when a fourth keel,
      coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed
      the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly
      hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to
      cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon
      the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not
      the command.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab?&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Spread yourselves,&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab; &amp;ldquo;give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
      pull out more to leeward!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&amp;rdquo; cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great
      steering oar. &amp;ldquo;Lay back!&amp;rdquo; addressing his crew. &amp;ldquo;There!&amp;mdash;there!&amp;mdash;there
      again! There she blows right ahead, boys!&amp;mdash;lay back!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind &amp;rsquo;em, sir,&amp;rdquo; said Archy; &amp;ldquo;I knew it
      all before now. Didn&amp;rsquo;t I hear &amp;rsquo;em in the hold? And didn&amp;rsquo;t I
      tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
      ones,&amp;rdquo; drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
      still showed signs of uneasiness. &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you break your backbones, my
      boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are
      only five more hands come to help us&amp;mdash;never mind from where&amp;mdash;the
      more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone&amp;mdash;devils
      are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that&amp;rsquo;s the stroke for
      a thousand pounds; that&amp;rsquo;s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men&amp;mdash;all hearts
      alive! Easy, easy; don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t be in a hurry. Why
      don&amp;rsquo;t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so,
      so, then:&amp;mdash;softly, softly! That&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s it! long and
      strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin
      rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.
      Pull, will ye? pull, can&amp;rsquo;t ye? pull, won&amp;rsquo;t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons
      and ginger-cakes don&amp;rsquo;t ye pull?&amp;mdash;pull and break something! pull, and
      start your eyes out! Here!&amp;rdquo; whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;
      &amp;ldquo;every mother&amp;rsquo;s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between
      his teeth. That&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s it. Now ye do something; that looks like
      it, my steel-bits. Start her&amp;mdash;start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
      marling-spikes!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stubb&amp;rsquo;s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather
      a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone
      so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated
      merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer
      invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere
      joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent
      himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped&amp;mdash;open-mouthed
      at times&amp;mdash;that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer
      force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was
      one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so
      curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter
      of obeying them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
      across Stubb&amp;rsquo;s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty
      near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
      please!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Halloa!&amp;rdquo; returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke;
      still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a
      flint from Stubb&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
      boys!)&amp;rdquo; in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: &amp;ldquo;A sad
      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There&amp;rsquo;s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
      Stubb, and that&amp;rsquo;s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm&amp;rsquo;s the
      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, I thought as much,&amp;rdquo; soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
      diverged, &amp;ldquo;as soon as I clapt eye on &amp;rsquo;em, I thought so. Aye, and that&amp;rsquo;s
      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale&amp;rsquo;s at the bottom of
      it. Well, well, so be it! Can&amp;rsquo;t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It
      ain&amp;rsquo;t the White Whale to-day! Give way!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as
      the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship&amp;rsquo;s company;
      but Archy&amp;rsquo;s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among
      them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure
      prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder;
      and so what with all this and Stubb&amp;rsquo;s confident way of accounting for
      their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious
      surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of
      wild conjectures as to dark Ahab&amp;rsquo;s precise agency in the matter from the
      beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen
      creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
      enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest
      to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance
      bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures
      of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose
      and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the
      boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi
      steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had
      thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the
      whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
      alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of
      the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer&amp;rsquo;s, thrown half backward into
      the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen
      steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the
      White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar
      motion and then remained fixed, while the boat&amp;rsquo;s five oars were seen
      simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly
      the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had
      irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly
      discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab
      had observed it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Every man look out along his oars!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck. &amp;ldquo;Thou, Queequeg,
      stand up!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the
      gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself
      to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the
      vast blue eye of the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Not very far distant Flask&amp;rsquo;s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
      commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort
      of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of
      the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its
      top is not more spacious than the palm of a man&amp;rsquo;s hand, and standing upon
      such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship
      which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and
      short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall
      ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means
      satisfy King-Post.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
      that.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
      shoulders for a pedestal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
      fifty feet taller.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
      Flask&amp;rsquo;s foot, and then putting Flask&amp;rsquo;s hand on his hearse-plumed head and
      bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling
      landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask
      now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband
      to lean against and steady himself by.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture
      in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and
      cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the
      loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask
      mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself
      with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble
      negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his
      broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked
      nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious
      little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added
      heave did he thereby give to the negro&amp;rsquo;s lordly chest. So have I seen
      Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth
      did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.
      The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary
      dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in
      such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with
      his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant
      like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his
      thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper
      of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
      windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect
      attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, &amp;ldquo;Down, down
      all, and give way!&amp;mdash;there they are!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were,
      like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
      couriers and detached flying outriders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water
      and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass
      of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pull, pull, my good boys,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to
      his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence
      of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar
      whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      How different the loud little King-Post. &amp;ldquo;Sing out and say something, my
      hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their
      black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ll sign over to you my
      Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay
      me on&amp;mdash;lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
      See! see that white water!&amp;rdquo; And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
      head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far
      off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat&amp;rsquo;s
      stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look at that chap now,&amp;rdquo; philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short
      distance, followed after&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes,
      give him fits&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s the very word&amp;mdash;pitch fits into &amp;rsquo;em.
      Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;&amp;mdash;merry&amp;rsquo;s
      the word. Pull, babes&amp;mdash;pull, sucklings&amp;mdash;pull, all. But what the
      devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only
      pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite
      your knives in two&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s all. Take it easy&amp;mdash;why don&amp;rsquo;t ye take
      it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
      his&amp;mdash;these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
      blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the
      audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and
      eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask
      to &amp;ldquo;that whale,&amp;rdquo; as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to
      be incessantly tantalizing his boat&amp;rsquo;s bow with its tail&amp;mdash;these
      allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would
      cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the
      shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out
      their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that
      they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these
      critical moments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
      the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the
      brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the
      knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to
      cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;
      the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the
      headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;&amp;mdash;all these, with the
      cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the
      oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her
      boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;&amp;mdash;all
      this was thrilling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
      heat of his first battle; not the dead man&amp;rsquo;s ghost encountering the first
      unknown phantom in the other world;&amp;mdash;neither of these can feel
      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time
      finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm
      whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
      visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung
      upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere
      to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats
      were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead
      to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we
      rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the
      lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from
      the row-locks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship
      nor boat to be seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Give way, men,&amp;rdquo; whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
      of his sail; &amp;ldquo;there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
      There&amp;rsquo;s white water again!&amp;mdash;close to! Spring!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that
      the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a
      lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: &amp;ldquo;Stand up!&amp;rdquo; and Queequeg,
      harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so
      close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the
      mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had
      come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants
      stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the
      mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of
      enraged serpents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s his hump. &lt;i&gt;There&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;, give it to him!&amp;rdquo; whispered Starbuck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew
      were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white
      curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended
      together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it
      we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
      water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
      the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of
      the ocean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire
      upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these
      jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live
      coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that
      storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the
      shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea
      forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as
      propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the
      lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
      contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif
      pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.
      There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that
      almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man
      without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we
      lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the
      sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly
      Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard
      a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The
      sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge,
      vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last
      loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much
      more than its length.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
      tossed and gaped beneath the ship&amp;rsquo;s bows like a chip at the base of a
      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more
      till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
      against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
      board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
      their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
      up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our
      perishing,&amp;mdash;an oar or a lance pole.

      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
      we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
      joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects
      that the joke is at nobody&amp;rsquo;s expense but his own. However, nothing
      dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all
      events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible
      and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion
      gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and
      worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all
      these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and
      jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old
      joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
      only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of
      his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing
      most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing
      like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,
      desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the
      Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
      and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?&amp;rdquo; Without
      much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand
      that such things did often happen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mr. Stubb,&amp;rdquo; said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; &amp;ldquo;Mr. Stubb, I
      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
      squall is the height of a whaleman&amp;rsquo;s discretion?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Certain. I&amp;rsquo;ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
      Horn.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mr. Flask,&amp;rdquo; said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
      by; &amp;ldquo;you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me
      whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
      oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death&amp;rsquo;s
      jaws?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you twist that smaller?&amp;rdquo; said Flask. &amp;ldquo;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s the law. I should
      like to see a boat&amp;rsquo;s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,
      ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of
      the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in
      the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
      occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively
      critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the
      hands of him who steered the boat&amp;mdash;oftentimes a fellow who at that
      very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft
      with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster
      to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s driving
      on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
      Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the
      fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s
      boat; and finally considering in what a devil&amp;rsquo;s chase I was implicated,
      touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I
      might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. &amp;ldquo;Queequeg,&amp;rdquo; said
      I, &amp;ldquo;come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
      last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond
      of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had
      done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present
      occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
      Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that
      Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so
      many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and
      burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and
      contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the
      bars of a snug family vault.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
      devil fetch the hindmost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 50. Ahab&amp;rsquo;s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who would have thought it, Flask!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb; &amp;ldquo;if I had but one leg you
      would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my
      timber toe. Oh! he&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful old man!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it so strange, after all, on that account,&amp;rdquo; said Flask. &amp;ldquo;If
      his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
      would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,
      you know.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the
      paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right
      for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the
      chase. So Tamerlane&amp;rsquo;s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
      whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest
      of the fight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man
      to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of
      the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
      entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the
      chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
      orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned
      to him as a regular headsman in the hunt&amp;mdash;above all for Captain Ahab
      to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat&amp;rsquo;s crew, he well knew
      that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the
      Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat&amp;rsquo;s crew from them, nor had he
      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken
      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco&amp;rsquo;s
      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure
      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time
      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the
      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which
      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when
      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an
      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he
      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat&amp;rsquo;s bow for bracing the
      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter&amp;rsquo;s chisel
      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in
      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he
      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as
      to any boat&amp;rsquo;s crew being assigned to that boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;
      for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;
      and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found
      tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,
      canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself
      might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the
      captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the
      forecastle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,
      by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked
      with Ahab&amp;rsquo;s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a
      half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority
      over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
      concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people
      in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but
      the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
      communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent&amp;mdash;those
      insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern
      days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth&amp;rsquo;s primal
      generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,
      and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as
      real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical
      Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.

      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept
      across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de
      Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la
      Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from
      St. Helena.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and,
      by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence,
      not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in
      advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked
      celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.
      Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was
      his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with
      the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales
      were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering
      for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this
      old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,
      companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there
      for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after
      all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,
      moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some
      winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.
      &amp;ldquo;There she blows!&amp;rdquo; Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have
      quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though
      it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so
      deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively
      desired a lowering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
      t&amp;rsquo;gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best
      man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the
      piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving,
      lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many
      sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet;
      while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were
      struggling in her&amp;mdash;one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive
      yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab&amp;rsquo;s face that
      night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were
      warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every
      stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this
      old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every
      eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more
      seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was
      descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into
      the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing
      again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at
      every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our
      van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with
      the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the
      Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and
      wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart
      latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same
      whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense
      of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously
      beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon
      us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
      potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
      all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for
      days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild,
      that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating
      itself of life before our urn-like prow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling
      around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
      there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored
      the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the
      foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life
      went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as
      though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing
      appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their
      homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black
      sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul
      were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of
      yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended
      us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty
      beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to
      swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air
      without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing
      its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,
      the solitary jet would at times be descried.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
      time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
      manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his
      mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft
      has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the
      issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So,
      with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand
      firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead
      to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but
      congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the
      forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over
      its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better
      to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of
      humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the
      men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even
      when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose
      in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man&amp;rsquo;s aspect, when one
      night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw
      him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
      and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
      emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the
      table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
      which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
      clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that
      the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that
      swung from a beam in the ceiling.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
      compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the
      course of the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,
      still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by
      name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head,
      I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean
      fisheries&amp;mdash;a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
      spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
      with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see
      her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in
      the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived
      nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast,
      they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
      slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to
      each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
      ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly
      eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while
      the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
      act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
      into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
      himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
      distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
      were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere
      mention of the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment
      paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board
      the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage
      of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her
      aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home,
      he loudly hailed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the
      world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and
      this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them
      to &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in
      accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that
      for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away
      with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with
      the stranger&amp;rsquo;s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings
      Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any
      monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Swim away from me, do ye?&amp;rdquo; murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
      helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
      turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
      wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Up
      helm! Keep her off round the world!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we
      left behind secure, were all the time before us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than
      any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the
      voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented
      chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all
      human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead
      us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
      spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not
      been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her&amp;mdash;judging
      by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions&amp;mdash;if so it had been
      that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the
      question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to
      consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could
      contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this
      might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the
      peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign
      seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
      equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each
      other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them,
      cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to
      interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting
      in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine
      Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying
      each other at the ends of the earth&amp;mdash;off lone Fanning&amp;rsquo;s Island, or
      the far away King&amp;rsquo;s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such
      circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into
      still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would
      this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one
      seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are
      personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear
      domestic things to talk about.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
      board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date
      a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.
      And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the
      latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be
      destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this
      will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other&amp;rsquo;s track on
      the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from
      home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some
      third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
      people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling
      news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all
      the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
      congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
      privations and perils.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that
      is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with
      Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of
      English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do
      occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your
      Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that
      sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
      sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American
      whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript
      provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in
      the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing
      that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the
      English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible
      in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to
      heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers
      have most reason to be sociable&amp;mdash;and they are so. Whereas, some
      merchant ships crossing each other&amp;rsquo;s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
      oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
      mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in
      Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon
      each other&amp;rsquo;s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they
      first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a
      ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty
      good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships
      meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each
      other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross
      each other&amp;rsquo;s cross-bones, the first hail is&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;How many skulls?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the
      same way that whalers hail&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;How many barrels?&amp;rdquo; And that question
      once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal
      villains on both sides, and don&amp;rsquo;t like to see overmuch of each other&amp;rsquo;s
      villanous likenesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
      free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
      whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Gam&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;rdquo; a thing so utterly
      unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if
      by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat
      gamesome stuff about &amp;ldquo;spouters&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blubber-boilers,&amp;rdquo; and such like
      pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all
      Pirates and Man-of-War&amp;rsquo;s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a
      scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard
      to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know
      whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It
      sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And
      besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper
      foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting
      himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate
      has no solid basis to stand on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what is a &lt;i&gt;Gam?&lt;/i&gt; You might wear out your index-finger running up and
      down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson
      never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster&amp;rsquo;s ark does not hold it.
      Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in
      constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it
      needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that
      view, let me learnedly define it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      GAM. NOUN&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;A social meeting of two&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;or more&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;Whaleships,
      generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits
      by boats&amp;rsquo; crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one
      ship, and the two chief mates on the other.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets
      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself
      with a pretty little milliner&amp;rsquo;s tiller decorated with gay cords and
      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort
      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains
      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent
      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such
      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat&amp;rsquo;s crew must leave
      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,
      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a
      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of
      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,
      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his
      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in
      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then
      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees
      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only
      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a
      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because
      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make
      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it
      would never do in plain sight of the world&amp;rsquo;s riveted eyes, it would never
      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the
      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as
      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands
      in his trowsers&amp;rsquo; pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy
      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred
      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known
      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say&amp;mdash;to
      seize hold of the nearest oarsman&amp;rsquo;s hair, and hold on there like grim
      death.

      CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho&amp;rsquo;s Story.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;As told at the Golden Inn.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
      much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more
      travellers than in any other part.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound
      whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by
      Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby
      Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly
      heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho&amp;rsquo;s story, which seemed
      obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted
      visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are
      said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own
      particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of
      the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab
      or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain
      of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate
      white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
      Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
      Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way,
      that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
      Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen
      in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange
      delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept
      the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the
      story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I
      now proceed to put on lasting record.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
      still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For my humor&amp;rsquo;s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
      it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint&amp;rsquo;s eve,
      smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine
      cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms
      with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and
      which are duly answered at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
      rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was
      cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days&amp;rsquo; sail eastward from the
      eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the
      Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it
      was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They
      supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having
      some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those
      latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not
      being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not
      find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather
      heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners
      working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came;
      more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
      sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,
      making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands,
      there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
      favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
      because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
      them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;
      never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole
      of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had
      all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the
      occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal
      overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked
      vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Lakeman!&amp;mdash;Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?&amp;rsquo; 
      said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but&amp;mdash;I crave your
      courtesy&amp;mdash;may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large
      and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla;
      this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been
      nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected
      with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand
      fresh-water seas of ours,&amp;mdash;Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
      Superior, and Michigan,&amp;mdash;possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with
      many of the ocean&amp;rsquo;s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
      even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great
      contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime
      approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all
      round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by
      the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet
      thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to
      wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
      wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
      forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic
      genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and
      silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they
      mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago
      villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed
      cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by
      Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave;
      they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,
      they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.
      Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and
      wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for
      Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone
      Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had
      long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,
      fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this
      Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
      mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
      firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which
      is the meanest slave&amp;rsquo;s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been
      retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far;
      but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt&amp;mdash;but, gentlemen,
      you shall hear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow
      for her island haven, that the Town-Ho&amp;rsquo;s leak seemed again increasing, but
      only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must
      know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example,
      some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of
      a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his
      duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates
      would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to
      the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the
      westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging
      at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
      length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any
      other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel
      is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded
      to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and
      as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his
      own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you
      can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this
      solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that
      it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were
      working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
      gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
      continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain
      spring, gentlemen&amp;mdash;that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck,
      and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
      world of ours&amp;mdash;watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in
      command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance
      he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern&amp;rsquo;s tower, and make a little
      heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all
      events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and
      a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy&amp;rsquo;s
      snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,
      which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to
      Charlemagne&amp;rsquo;s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as
      hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt
      knew it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
      rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his
      gay banterings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Aye, aye, my merry lads, it&amp;rsquo;s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one
      of ye, and let&amp;rsquo;s have a taste. By the Lord, it&amp;rsquo;s worth bottling! I tell ye
      what, men, old Rad&amp;rsquo;s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his
      part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only
      began the job; he&amp;rsquo;s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,
      saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of &amp;rsquo;em are now
      hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I
      suppose. If old Rad were here now, I&amp;rsquo;d tell him to jump overboard and
      scatter &amp;rsquo;em. They&amp;rsquo;re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.
      But he&amp;rsquo;s a simple old soul,&amp;mdash;Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say
      the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he&amp;rsquo;d
      give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Damn your eyes! what&amp;rsquo;s that pump stopping for?&amp;rsquo; roared Radney,
      pretending not to have heard the sailors&amp;rsquo; talk. &amp;lsquo;Thunder away at it!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Aye, aye, sir,&amp;rsquo; said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. &amp;lsquo;Lively, boys,
      lively, now!&amp;rsquo; And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the
      men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the
      lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life&amp;rsquo;s utmost
      energies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
      forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery
      red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now
      what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle
      with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so
      it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him
      to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove
      some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship&amp;rsquo;s deck at sea is a piece of household
      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if
      boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that
      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most
      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain
      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any
      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
      case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may
      understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in
      his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand
      this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended
      when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and
      as he steadfastly looked into the mate&amp;rsquo;s malignant eye and perceived the
      stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently
      burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange
      forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any
      already ireful being&amp;mdash;a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by
      really valiant men even when aggrieved&amp;mdash;this nameless phantom
      feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the
      deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at
      all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
      sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing
      all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and
      outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile
      advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper&amp;rsquo;s club
      hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could
      but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the
      conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to
      his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few
      inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his
      intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the
      slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted
      hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no
      purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
      when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
      now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on
      the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
      yourself.&amp;rsquo; But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
      the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his
      teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
      Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
      with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right
      hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that
      if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But,
      gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.
      Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw
      of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood
      like a whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
      leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
      mastheads. They were both Canallers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Canallers!&amp;rsquo; cried Don Pedro. &amp;lsquo;We have seen many whale-ships in our
      harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
      they?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You
      must have heard of it.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
      land, we know but little of your vigorous North.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha&amp;rsquo;s very fine; and ere
      proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
      information may throw side-light upon my story.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth
      of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most
      thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,
      cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and
      bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches
      over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;
      through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties;
      and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost
      like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and
      often lawless life. There&amp;rsquo;s your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your
      pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung
      shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious
      fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they
      ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most
      abound in holiest vicinities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Is that a friar passing?&amp;rsquo; said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
      crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella&amp;rsquo;s Inquisition wanes in
      Lima,&amp;rsquo; laughed Don Sebastian. &amp;lsquo;Proceed, Senor.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;A moment! Pardon!&amp;rsquo; cried another of the company. &amp;lsquo;In the name of all us
      Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no
      means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
      distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
      surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Corrupt as
      Lima.&amp;rdquo; It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
      billiard-tables, and for ever open&amp;mdash;and &amp;ldquo;Corrupt as Lima.&amp;rdquo; So, too,
      Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
      Mark!&amp;mdash;St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now,
      you pour out again.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a
      fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like
      Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he
      indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening
      his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is
      dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his
      slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to
      the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
      visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on
      his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I
      thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of
      the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he
      has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a
      wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is,
      is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
      many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind,
      except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor
      does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
      thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
      probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between
      quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the
      waters of the most barbaric seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I see! I see!&amp;rsquo; impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon
      his silvery ruffles. &amp;lsquo;No need to travel! The world&amp;rsquo;s one Lima. I had
      thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and
      holy as the hills.&amp;mdash;But the story.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had
      he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four
      harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes
      like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought
      to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors
      joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while
      standing out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a
      whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
      scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran
      close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the
      heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his
      resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all;
      they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
      about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
      sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Come out of that, ye pirates!&amp;rsquo; roared the captain, now menacing them
      with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. &amp;lsquo;Come out
      of that, ye cut-throats!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied
      the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand
      distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&amp;rsquo;s) death would be the signal for a
      murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this
      might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still
      commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&amp;rsquo; demanded their ringleader.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Turn to! turn to!&amp;mdash;I make no promise;&amp;mdash;to your duty! Do you
      want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!&amp;rsquo; and
      he once more raised a pistol.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Sink the ship?&amp;rsquo; cried Steelkilt. &amp;lsquo;Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
      turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say
      ye, men?&amp;rsquo; turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on
      the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not our
      fault; we didn&amp;rsquo;t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy&amp;rsquo;s
      business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the
      buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;
      ain&amp;rsquo;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to
      those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the
      word; don&amp;rsquo;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us
      decently, and we&amp;rsquo;re your men; but we won&amp;rsquo;t be flogged.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Look ye, now,&amp;rsquo; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
      &amp;lsquo;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
      the cruise, d&amp;rsquo;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
      discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&amp;rsquo;t want a row; it&amp;rsquo;s not
      our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&amp;rsquo;t
      be flogged.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Turn to!&amp;rsquo; roared the Captain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;I tell you
      what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
      shabby rascal, we won&amp;rsquo;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but
      till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&amp;rsquo;t do a hand&amp;rsquo;s turn.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep ye there till
      ye&amp;rsquo;re sick of it. Down ye go.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Shall we?&amp;rsquo; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
      it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into
      their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;As the Lakeman&amp;rsquo;s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
      and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of
      the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for
      the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
      companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something
      down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them&amp;mdash;ten in
      number&amp;mdash;leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
      aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which
      last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
      through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the
      men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose
      clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally
      resounded through the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
      the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then
      lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
      after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the
      Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this
      was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a
      scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly
      four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
      The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to
      some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
      discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the
      rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling
      and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of
      the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that
      sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Better turn to, now?&amp;rsquo; said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Shut us up again, will ye!&amp;rsquo; cried Steelkilt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Oh certainly,&amp;rsquo; said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven
      of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last
      hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the
      bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two
      Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their
      hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen
      mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each
      end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
      devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he
      would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last
      night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition
      on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for
      any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was
      more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time
      to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely
      objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two
      comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of
      them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time.
      And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
      separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of
      treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the
      first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby
      secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when
      Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last,
      they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before
      secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze,
      verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound
      the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for
      the Captain at midnight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and
      all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few
      minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
      struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies,
      who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe
      for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like
      dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging,
      like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. &amp;lsquo;Damn ye,&amp;rsquo; 
      cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, &amp;lsquo;the vultures would not
      touch ye, ye villains!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
      from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he
      had a good mind to flog them all round&amp;mdash;thought, upon the whole, he
      would do so&amp;mdash;he ought to&amp;mdash;justice demanded it; but for the
      present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a
      reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&amp;rsquo; turning to the three men in the
      rigging&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;&amp;rsquo; and,
      seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
      traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
      sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;My wrist is sprained with ye!&amp;rsquo; he cried, at last; &amp;lsquo;but there is still
      rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up. Take that
      gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
      cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort
      of hiss, &amp;lsquo;What I say is this&amp;mdash;and mind it well&amp;mdash;if you flog me,
      I murder you!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;and the Captain drew off
      with the rope to strike.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Best not,&amp;rsquo; hissed the Lakeman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;But I must,&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
      who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
      two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, &amp;lsquo;I
      won&amp;rsquo;t do it&amp;mdash;let him go&amp;mdash;cut him down: d&amp;rsquo;ye hear?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,
      with a bandaged head, arrested them&amp;mdash;Radney the chief mate. Ever
      since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
      tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole
      scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but
      mumbling something about &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; being willing and able to do what the captain
      dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You are a coward!&amp;rsquo; hissed the Lakeman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;So I am, but take that.&amp;rsquo; The mate was in the very act of striking, when
      another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more,
      made good his word, spite of Steelkilt&amp;rsquo;s threat, whatever that might have
      been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and,
      sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was
      heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
      besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
      Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
      instance they were put down in the ship&amp;rsquo;s run for salvation. Still, no
      sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that
      mainly at Steelkilt&amp;rsquo;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the
      strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship
      reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest
      end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing&amp;mdash;namely, not to
      sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her
      leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her
      mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that
      moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and
      Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and
      with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
      passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all
      was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
      had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief
      mate&amp;rsquo;s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half
      way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against
      the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at
      night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt
      systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
      bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the
      boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship&amp;rsquo;s side. In this
      attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable
      vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.
      Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm
      would come round at two o&amp;rsquo;clock, in the morning of the third day from that
      in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in
      braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;What are you making there?&amp;rsquo; said a shipmate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;What do you think? what does it look like?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&amp;rsquo;s an odd one, seems to me.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Yes, rather oddish,&amp;rsquo; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&amp;rsquo;s length before
      him; &amp;lsquo;but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven&amp;rsquo;t enough twine,&amp;mdash;have
      you any?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But there was none in the forecastle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Then I must get some from old Rad;&amp;rsquo; and he rose to go aft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t mean to go a begging to &lt;i&gt;him!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo; said a sailor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Why not? Do you think he won&amp;rsquo;t do me a turn, when it&amp;rsquo;s to help himself
      in the end, shipmate?&amp;rsquo; and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly,
      and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him&amp;mdash;neither
      twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball,
      closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&amp;rsquo;s monkey
      jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.
      Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm&amp;mdash;nigh to the
      man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman&amp;rsquo;s
      hand&amp;mdash;that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining
      soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse,
      with his forehead crushed in.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed
      he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
      avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to
      take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
      day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,
      drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, &amp;lsquo;There she
      rolls! there she rolls!&amp;rsquo; Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Moby Dick!&amp;rsquo; cried Don Sebastian; &amp;lsquo;St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales
      have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;&amp;mdash;but
      that would be too long a story.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;How? how?&amp;rsquo; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Nay, Dons, Dons&amp;mdash;nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get
      more into the air, Sirs.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The chicha! the chicha!&amp;rsquo; cried Don Pedro; &amp;lsquo;our vigorous friend looks
      faint;&amp;mdash;fill up his empty glass!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.&amp;mdash;Now, gentlemen, so
      suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship&amp;mdash;forgetful
      of the compact among the crew&amp;mdash;in the excitement of the moment, the
      Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the
      monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from
      the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &amp;lsquo;The White Whale&amp;mdash;the
      White Whale!&amp;rsquo; was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,
      undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and
      precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the
      appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal
      spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue
      morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of
      these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
      The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was
      his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the
      prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover,
      when the four boats were lowered, the mate&amp;rsquo;s got the start; and none
      howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at
      his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in
      hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in
      a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&amp;rsquo;s topmost
      back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck
      as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing
      mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale&amp;rsquo;s slippery back, the boat
      righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over
      into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the
      spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
      seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed
      round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and
      rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&amp;rsquo;s bottom, the Lakeman had
      slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
      looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward
      jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and
      the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some
      tatters of Radney&amp;rsquo;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had
      destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them,
      and finally wholly disappeared.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port&amp;mdash;a savage, solitary place&amp;mdash;where
      no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five
      or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms;
      eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the
      savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The ship&amp;rsquo;s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
      upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down
      the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their
      dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night
      and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the
      vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition
      that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After
      taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as
      possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his
      muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at
      their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
      whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
      miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
      to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the
      savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him
      to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a
      pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman
      laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked
      in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;What do you want of me?&amp;rsquo; cried the captain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&amp;rsquo; demanded Steelkilt;
      &amp;lsquo;no lies.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Very good. Let me board you a moment&amp;mdash;I come in peace.&amp;rsquo; With that
      he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
      stood face to face with the captain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
      soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island,
      and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;A pretty scholar,&amp;rsquo; laughed the Lakeman. &amp;lsquo;Adios, Senor!&amp;rsquo; and leaping into
      the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots
      of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived
      at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two
      ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of
      precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and
      so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all
      minded to work them legal retribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and
      the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who
      had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he
      returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again
      resumed his cruisings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
      Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
      give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
      destroyed him.  * * * * 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Are you through?&amp;rsquo; said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I am, Don.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this
      your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did
      you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to
      press.&amp;rsquo;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s
      suit,&amp;rsquo; cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Nay,&amp;rsquo; said Don Sebastian; &amp;lsquo;but I know a worthy priest near by, who will
      quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this
      may grow too serious.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Though there are no Auto-da-FÃ©s in Lima now,&amp;rsquo; said one of the company
      to another; &amp;lsquo;I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
      Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.&amp;rsquo; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that
      you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you
      can.&amp;rsquo;

      gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and
      hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen,
      is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it
      happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and
      talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something
      like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the
      whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the
      whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth
      while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary
      portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge
      the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this
      matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be
      found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever
      since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings
      of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups,
      and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin&amp;rsquo;s,
      and a helmeted head like St. George&amp;rsquo;s; ever since then has something of
      the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of
      the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
      be the whale&amp;rsquo;s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,
      in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
      that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable
      avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
      into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
      whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred
      to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation
      of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.
      But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give
      the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It
      looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of
      the true whale&amp;rsquo;s majestic flukes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter&amp;rsquo;s
      portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
      Hindoo. It is Guido&amp;rsquo;s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the
      sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange
      creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own
      &amp;ldquo;Perseus Descending,&amp;rdquo; make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of
      that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one
      inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended
      tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the
      Traitors&amp;rsquo; Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then,
      there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah&amp;rsquo;s whale,
      as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What
      shall be said of these? As for the book-binder&amp;rsquo;s whale winding like a
      vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor&amp;mdash;as stamped and
      gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new&amp;mdash;that
      is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it,
      from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a
      dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder&amp;rsquo;s fish an attempt at a
      whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It
      was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th
      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down
      to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
      species of the Leviathan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
      at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of
      spouts, jets d&amp;rsquo;eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come
      bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original
      edition of the &amp;ldquo;Advancement of Learning&amp;rdquo; you will find some curious
      whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
      pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by
      those who know. In old Harris&amp;rsquo;s collection of voyages there are some
      plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
      entitled &amp;ldquo;A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale,
      Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.&amp;rdquo; In one of those plates the whales,
      like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with
      white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
      prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
      flukes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a
      Post Captain in the English navy, entitled &amp;ldquo;A Voyage round Cape Horn into
      the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
      Fisheries.&amp;rdquo; In this book is an outline purporting to be a &amp;ldquo;Picture of a
      Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast
      of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.&amp;rdquo; I doubt not the captain had
      this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention
      but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied,
      according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would
      make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my
      gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
      benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
      mistake. Look at that popular work &amp;ldquo;Goldsmith&amp;rsquo;s Animated Nature.&amp;rdquo; In the
      abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged &amp;ldquo;whale&amp;rdquo;
       and a &amp;ldquo;narwhale.&amp;rdquo; I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly
      whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one
      glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such
      a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of
      schoolboys.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de LacÃ©pÃ¨de, a great
      naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
      several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are
      not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale
      (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man
      as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
      reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron.
      In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what
      he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any
      Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.
      In a word, Frederick Cuvier&amp;rsquo;s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a
      squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men
      seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he
      got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one
      of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort
      of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
      saucers inform us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As for the sign-painters&amp;rsquo; whales seen in the streets hanging over the
      shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
      Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting
      on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their
      deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
      surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been
      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing
      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble
      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though
      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has
      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in
      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like
      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing
      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so
      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of
      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale
      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of
      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship&amp;rsquo;s deck, such is then the
      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise
      expression the devil himself could not catch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
      accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it
      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton
      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham&amp;rsquo;s
      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his
      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old
      gentleman, with all Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s other leading personal characteristics; yet
      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan&amp;rsquo;s articulated
      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale
      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the
      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This
      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this
      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in
      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,
      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently
      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial
      covering. &amp;ldquo;However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,&amp;rdquo; said
      humorous Stubb one day, &amp;ldquo;he can never be truly said to handle us without
      mittens.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which
      must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark
      much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable
      degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely
      what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can
      derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling
      yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove
      and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too
      fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted
      here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to
      be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny,
      Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
      Colnett&amp;rsquo;s, Huggins&amp;rsquo;s, Frederick Cuvier&amp;rsquo;s, and Beale&amp;rsquo;s. In the previous
      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins&amp;rsquo;s is far better
      than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale&amp;rsquo;s is the best. All Beale&amp;rsquo;s drawings
      of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of
      three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His
      frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to
      excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and
      life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.
      Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly
      engraved. That is not his fault though.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because
      it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
      anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
      hunters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not
      the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken
      from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the
      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is
      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the
      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the
      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially
      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster&amp;rsquo;s spine; and
      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you
      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the
      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of
      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub
      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about
      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black
      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault
      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that
      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the
      barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy
      bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His
      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a
      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking
      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,
      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale
      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the
      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in
      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.
      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable
      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping
      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead
      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from
      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was
      either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
      tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting
      action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you
      find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in
      that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,
      pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every
      sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings
      and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly
      unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of
      Garnery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England&amp;rsquo;s
      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale
      hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem
      entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as
      the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of
      effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a
      pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving
      us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
      miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical
      engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the
      microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a
      shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.
      I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a
      veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not
      to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a
      Greenland Justice of the Peace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself &amp;ldquo;H.
      Durand.&amp;rdquo; One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose,
      nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene
      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a
      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,
      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together
      in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with
      reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few
      aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different
      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of
      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,
      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase
      to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;
      three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden
      roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like
      a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling
      whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to
      windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains,
      seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
      crippled beggar (or &lt;i&gt;kedger&lt;/i&gt;, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
      before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There
      are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to
      contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched
      by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me,
      has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an
      incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His
      three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any
      rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the
      western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a
      stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands
      ruefully contemplating his own amputation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
      Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes,
      graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies&amp;rsquo; busks
      wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles,
      as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they
      elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean
      leisure. Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements,
      specially intended for the skrimshandering business. But, in general, they
      toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool
      of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a
      mariner&amp;rsquo;s fancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to
      that condition in which God placed him, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; what is called savagery. Your
      true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a
      savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready
      at any moment to rebel against him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
      hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club
      or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is
      as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but
      a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark&amp;rsquo;s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of
      wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady
      application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
      same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark&amp;rsquo;s tooth, of his
      one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite
      as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the
      Greek savage, Achilles&amp;rsquo;s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
      suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the
      noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of
      American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by
      the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy,
      the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom
      remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned
      churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks;
      but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes
      so labelled with &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Hands off!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; you cannot examine them closely enough to
      decide upon their merit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
      cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
      you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan
      partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf
      of green surges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
      girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point
      of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined
      along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see
      these sights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight
      again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and
      longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like are such
      observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-point would
      require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still
      remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old
      Figuera chronicled them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
      great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when
      long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in
      battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round
      and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first
      defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have
      boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far
      beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a frigate&amp;rsquo;s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
      spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see
      whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
      encamped beyond my mortal sight!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 58. Brit.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of
      brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely
      feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to
      be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the
      attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam
      through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous
      Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the
      water that escaped at the lip.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
      scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters
      swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them
      endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the &amp;ldquo;Brazil Banks&amp;rdquo; does not
      bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being
      shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
      appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in
      those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
      reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
      paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more
      like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great
      hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass
      on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking
      them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him,
      who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.
      And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
      hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly
      be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog
      or a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep
      with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old
      naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their
      kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this
      may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the
      ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious
      kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect
      be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
      have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;
      though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that
      Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one
      superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all
      mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and
      hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a
      moment&amp;rsquo;s consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his
      science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science
      and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom,
      the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
      frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these
      very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea
      which aboriginally belongs to it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
      vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
      That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of
      last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah&amp;rsquo;s flood is not yet subsided; two
      thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
      miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
      when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
      swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
      precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is
      also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
      murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
      spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own
      cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and
      leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,
      no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle
      steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
      under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
      beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
      brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
      dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
      the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
      other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
      earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
      strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
      surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
      Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
      half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst
      never return!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 59. Squid.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
      way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her
      keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts
      mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And
      still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet
      would be seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
      spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the
      long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across
      them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together
      as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a
      strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
      higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
      our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a
      moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and
      silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
      thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
      more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
      negro yelled out&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;There! there again! there she breaches! right
      ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
      bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the
      bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his
      orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated
      aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
      gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
      ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale
      he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him;
      whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the
      white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for
      lowering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab&amp;rsquo;s in advance, and all swiftly
      pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars
      suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where
      it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all
      thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which
      the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass,
      furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating
      on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling
      and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any
      hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no
      conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on
      the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
      gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
      exclaimed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than
      to have seen thee, thou white ghost!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What was it, Sir?&amp;rdquo; said Flask.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
      returned to their ports to tell of it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the
      rest as silently following.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
      the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so
      very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
      portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
      declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of
      them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
      form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his
      only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water,
      and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains
      his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference
      is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At
      times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the
      detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty
      and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms
      belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the
      sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to
      attack and tear it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
      Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which
      the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some
      other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much
      abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
      creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
      to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
      but only as the Anak of the tribe.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 60. The Line.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
      for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I
      have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
      vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
      ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to
      the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
      sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too
      much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
      subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
      means adds to the rope&amp;rsquo;s durability or strength, however much it may give
      it compactness and gloss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
      superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
      as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add
      (since there is an Ã¦sthetics in all things), is much more handsome and
      becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of
      Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight,
      you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one
      and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty
      pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three
      tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something over two
      hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away
      in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form
      one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded &amp;ldquo;sheaves,&amp;rdquo; or layers of
      concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the &amp;ldquo;heart,&amp;rdquo; or minute
      vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or
      kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody&amp;rsquo;s arm,
      leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line
      in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this
      business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards
      through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it
      from all possible wrinkles and twists.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being
      continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because
      these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do
      not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in
      diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a
      craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of
      the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable
      distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the
      painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks
      as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present
      to the whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
      eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub,
      and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
      arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
      to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring
      boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to
      carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these
      instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were,
      from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at
      hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for
      common safety&amp;rsquo;s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way
      attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the
      end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
      stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him
      into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever
      find her again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken
      aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried
      forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or
      handle of every man&amp;rsquo;s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing;
      and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite
      gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of
      the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill,
      prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight
      festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some
      ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the
      bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and
      is then attached to the short-warp&amp;mdash;the rope which is immediately
      connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp
      goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
      twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen
      are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the
      landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes
      sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for
      the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while
      straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant
      the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in
      play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a
      shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a
      shaken jelly. Yet habit&amp;mdash;strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?&amp;mdash;Gayer
      sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never
      heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white
      cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman&amp;rsquo;s nooses; and, like the
      six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
      pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may
      say.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
      repeated whaling disasters&amp;mdash;some few of which are casually chronicled&amp;mdash;of
      this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
      For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like
      being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in
      full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
      It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils,
      because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and
      the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain
      self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can
      you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing
      sun himself could never pierce you out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies
      of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed,
      the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in
      itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the
      ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it
      silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual
      play&amp;mdash;this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any
      other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live
      enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but
      it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals
      realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a
      philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel
      one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with
      a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.

      CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
      Queequeg it was quite a different object.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;When you see him &amp;rsquo;quid,&amp;rdquo; said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
      of his hoisted boat, &amp;ldquo;then you quick see him &amp;rsquo;parm whale.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to
      engage them, the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
      induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
      which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
      that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
      and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the
      Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
      leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
      what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that
      dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;
      though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the
      power which first moved it is withdrawn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
      at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all
      three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we
      made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves,
      too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea,
      east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
      hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
      with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
      fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
      capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
      glistening in the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the
      trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,
      the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
      afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
      enchanter&amp;rsquo;s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
      started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
      of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
      forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
      the sparkling brine into the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Clear away the boats! Luff!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
      dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
      the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
      but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
      that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders
      that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So
      seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but
      silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails
      being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster
      perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank
      out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There go flukes!&amp;rdquo; was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
      Stubb&amp;rsquo;s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
      granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
      rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker&amp;rsquo;s boat, and much nearer
      to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the
      capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of
      his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.
      Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at
      his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he
      was going &amp;ldquo;head out&amp;rdquo;; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast
      which he brewed.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
      entire interior of the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s enormous head consists. Though
      apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him.
      So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when
      going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part
      of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the
      lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said
      to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a
      sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Start her, start her, my men! Don&amp;rsquo;t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&amp;mdash;but
      start her; start her like thunder-claps, that&amp;rsquo;s all,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb,
      spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. &amp;ldquo;Start her, now; give &amp;rsquo;em the long
      and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&amp;mdash;start her, all;
      but keep cool, keep cool&amp;mdash;cucumbers is the word&amp;mdash;easy, easy&amp;mdash;only
      start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead
      perpendicular out of their graves, boys&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s all. Start her!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!&amp;rdquo; screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
      war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
      involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which
      the eager Indian gave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. &amp;ldquo;Kee-hee!
      Kee-hee!&amp;rdquo; yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
      like a pacing tiger in his cage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ka-la! Koo-loo!&amp;rdquo; howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful
      of Grenadier&amp;rsquo;s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.
      Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men
      to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like
      desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Stand
      up, Tashtego!&amp;mdash;give it to him!&amp;rdquo; The harpoon was hurled. &amp;ldquo;Stern all!&amp;rdquo;
       The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing
      along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant
      before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the
      loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen
      blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.
      As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before
      reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of
      Stubb&amp;rsquo;s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas
      sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like
      holding an enemy&amp;rsquo;s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all
      the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wet the line! wet the line!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
      by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
      turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
      flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
      here changed places&amp;mdash;stem for stern&amp;mdash;a staggering business truly
      in that rocking commotion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated,
      that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line
      with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart
      for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
      the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
      have thought the craft had two keels&amp;mdash;one cleaving the water, the
      other the air&amp;mdash;as the boat churned on through both opposing elements
      at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
      in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
      little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
      gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
      clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
      form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to
      bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed
      passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat
      slackened his flight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Haul in&amp;mdash;haul in!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
      towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
      the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
      planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
      flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of
      the way of the whale&amp;rsquo;s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another
      fling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
      hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
      and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
      upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
      face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the
      while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle
      of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited
      headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line
      attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid
      blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pull up&amp;mdash;pull up!&amp;rdquo; he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
      relaxed in his wrath. &amp;ldquo;Pull up!&amp;mdash;close to!&amp;rdquo; and the boat ranged along
      the fish&amp;rsquo;s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his
      long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and
      churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the
      whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he
      could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of
      the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that
      unspeakable thing called his &amp;ldquo;flurry,&amp;rdquo; the monster horribly wallowed in
      his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so
      that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly
      to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
      day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
      surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his
      spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush
      after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
      wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
      down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s dead, Mr. Stubb,&amp;rdquo; said Daggoo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes; both pipes smoked out!&amp;rdquo; and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
      Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
      thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
      off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
      steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar,
      the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to
      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long
      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or
      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the
      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,
      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not
      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one&amp;rsquo;s compass, while all the
      other muscles are strained and half started&amp;mdash;what that is none know
      but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work
      very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling
      state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted
      harpooneer hears the exciting cry&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Stand up, and give it to him!&amp;rdquo; He
      now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way,
      seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may
      remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking
      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for
      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless
      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them
      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm
      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many
      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
      you expect to find it there when most wanted!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
      themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
      headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station
      in the bows of the boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
      and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last;
      he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever
      should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any
      fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed
      in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one
      nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the
      fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as
      the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
      world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
      toil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
      productive subjects, grow the chapters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It
      is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is
      perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the
      purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon,
      whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby
      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as
      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It
      is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively
      called the first and second irons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the
      line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly
      after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one
      should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of
      the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous,
      violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it
      becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his
      movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second
      iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence
      that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
      somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all
      hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare
      coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in
      most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always
      unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard,
      it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly
      curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting
      them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in
      general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly
      captured and a corpse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one
      unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities
      in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an
      audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
      simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied
      with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be
      ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
      faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most
      important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.

      CHAPTER 64. Stubb&amp;rsquo;s Supper.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stubb&amp;rsquo;s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm;
      so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of
      towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our
      thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly
      toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it
      seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was
      hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the
      great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five
      laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of
      a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
      laden with pig-lead in bulk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
      dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing
      the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it
      for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into
      the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced
      his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead,
      some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in
      him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet
      to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship,
      all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon
      you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s decks, that all
      hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are
      being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
      But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to
      be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the
      whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel&amp;rsquo;s and seen through
      the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the
      two&amp;mdash;ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,
      whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is
      by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so
      that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the
      chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small,
      strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight
      in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit
      management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass,
      so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow
      suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
      smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes
      or lobes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on
      deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual
      but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that
      the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the
      time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this
      liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high
      liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish
      thing to his palate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me
      one from his small!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
      thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
      the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of
      the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have
      a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by
      Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns
      of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the
      capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only
      banqueter on whale&amp;rsquo;s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his
      own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the
      dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below
      in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails
      against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers&amp;rsquo; hearts. Peering
      over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing
      in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they
      scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human
      head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at
      such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
      symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
      things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the
      hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
      will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship&amp;rsquo;s decks, like hungry dogs
      round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
      killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers
      over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other&amp;rsquo;s live meat
      with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their
      jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the
      dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it
      would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking
      sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the
      invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic,
      systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be
      carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or
      two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms,
      places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
      hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you
      will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial
      spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at
      sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about
      the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the
      devil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going
      on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own
      epicurean lips.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook, cook!&amp;mdash;where&amp;rsquo;s that old Fleece?&amp;rdquo; he cried at length, widening
      his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
      and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with
      his lance; &amp;ldquo;cook, you cook!&amp;mdash;sail this way, cook!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused
      from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along
      from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter
      with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other
      pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping
      along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion,
      were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and
      in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite
      side of Stubb&amp;rsquo;s sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and
      resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further
      over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his
      best ear into play.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,
      &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t you think this steak is rather overdone? You&amp;rsquo;ve been beating this
      steak too much, cook; it&amp;rsquo;s too tender. Don&amp;rsquo;t I always say that to be good,
      a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side,
      don&amp;rsquo;t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are
      kicking up! Cook, go and talk to &amp;rsquo;em; tell &amp;rsquo;em they are welcome to help
      themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me,
      if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take
      this lantern,&amp;rdquo; snatching one from his sideboard; &amp;ldquo;now then, go and preach
      to &amp;rsquo;em!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to
      the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea,
      so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he
      solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling
      voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind,
      overheard all that was said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Fellow-critters: I&amp;rsquo;se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise
      dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin&amp;rsquo; ob de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you
      can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop
      dat dam racket!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook,&amp;rdquo; here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap on
      the shoulder,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn&amp;rsquo;t swear that way
      when you&amp;rsquo;re preaching. That&amp;rsquo;s no way to convert sinners, cook!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,&amp;rdquo; sullenly turning to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, cook; go on, go on.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Right!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, &amp;ldquo;coax &amp;rsquo;em to it; try that,&amp;rdquo; and
      Fleece continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
      fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;top dat dam slappin&amp;rsquo; ob de
      tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin&amp;rsquo; and
      bitin&amp;rsquo; dare?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, collaring him, &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t have that swearing. Talk to
      &amp;rsquo;em gentlemanly.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once more the sermon proceeded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don&amp;rsquo;t blame ye so much for;
      dat is natur, and can&amp;rsquo;t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
      de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den
      you be angel; for all angel is not&amp;rsquo;ing more dan de shark well goberned.
      Now, look here, bred&amp;rsquo;ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs
      from dat whale. Don&amp;rsquo;t be tearin&amp;rsquo; de blubber out your neighbour&amp;rsquo;s
      mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none
      on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I
      know some o&amp;rsquo; you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig
      mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not
      to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat
      can&amp;rsquo;t get into de scrouge to help demselves.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well done, old Fleece!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s Christianity; go on.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No use goin&amp;rsquo; on; de dam willains will keep a scougin&amp;rsquo; and slappin&amp;rsquo; each
      oder, Massa Stubb; dey don&amp;rsquo;t hear one word; no use a-preachin&amp;rsquo; to such dam
      g&amp;rsquo;uttons as you call &amp;rsquo;em, till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is
      bottomless; and when dey do get &amp;rsquo;em full, dey wont hear you den; for den
      dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and can&amp;rsquo;t hear not&amp;rsquo;ing
      at all, no more, for eber and eber.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
      Fleece, and I&amp;rsquo;ll away to my supper.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
      shrill voice, and cried&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
      your dam&amp;rsquo; bellies &amp;rsquo;till dey bust&amp;mdash;and den die.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, cook,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; &amp;ldquo;stand just
      where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
      attention.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All dention,&amp;rdquo; said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
      desired position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; &amp;ldquo;I shall now go back
      to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What dat do wid de &amp;rsquo;teak,&amp;rdquo; said the old black, testily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Silence! How old are you, cook?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;Bout ninety, dey say,&amp;rdquo; he gloomily muttered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and
      don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?&amp;rdquo; rapidly bolting another
      mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
      question. &amp;ldquo;Where were you born, cook?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin&amp;rsquo; ober de Roanoke.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Born in a ferry-boat! That&amp;rsquo;s queer, too. But I want to know what country
      you were born in, cook!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I say de Roanoke country?&amp;rdquo; he cried sharply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, you didn&amp;rsquo;t, cook; but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what I&amp;rsquo;m coming to, cook. You
      must go home and be born over again; you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook a
      whale-steak yet.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,&amp;rdquo; he growled, angrily, turning round
      to depart.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come back, cook;&amp;mdash;here, hand me those tongs;&amp;mdash;now take
      that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
      should be? Take it, I say&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;holding the tongs towards him&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;take
      it, and taste it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
      muttered, &amp;ldquo;Best cooked &amp;rsquo;teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, squaring himself once more; &amp;ldquo;do you belong to the
      church?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Passed one once in Cape-Down,&amp;rdquo; said the old man sullenly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where
      you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his
      beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell
      me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?&amp;rdquo; said Stubb. &amp;ldquo;Where do you
      expect to go to, cook?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Go to bed berry soon,&amp;rdquo; he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It&amp;rsquo;s an awful question. Now
      what&amp;rsquo;s your answer?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;When dis old brack man dies,&amp;rdquo; said the negro slowly, changing his whole
      air and demeanor, &amp;ldquo;he hisself won&amp;rsquo;t go nowhere; but some bressed angel
      will come and fetch him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
      him where?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Up dere,&amp;rdquo; said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
      keeping it there very solemnly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you
      are dead? But don&amp;rsquo;t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?
      Main-top, eh?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t say dat t&amp;rsquo;all,&amp;rdquo; said Fleece, again in the sulks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;You said up there, didn&amp;rsquo;t you? and now look yourself, and see where your
      tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling
      through the lubber&amp;rsquo;s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don&amp;rsquo;t get there,
      except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It&amp;rsquo;s a ticklish
      business, but must be done, or else it&amp;rsquo;s no go. But none of us are in
      heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold
      your hat in one hand, and clap t&amp;rsquo;other a&amp;rsquo;top of your heart, when I&amp;rsquo;m
      giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s your
      gizzard! Aloft! aloft!&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;mdash;now you have it. Hold it
      there now, and pay attention.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All &amp;rsquo;dention,&amp;rdquo; said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
      vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one
      and the same time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that
      I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don&amp;rsquo;t you?
      Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private
      table here, the capstan, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by
      overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the
      other; that done, dish it; d&amp;rsquo;ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are
      cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins;
      have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused,
      cook. There, now ye may go.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D&amp;rsquo;ye
      hear? away you sail, then.&amp;mdash;Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.&amp;mdash;Avast
      heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t forget.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wish, by gor! whale eat him, &amp;rsquo;stead of him eat whale. I&amp;rsquo;m bressed if he
      ain&amp;rsquo;t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,&amp;rdquo; muttered the old man,
      limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
      like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
      outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
      philosophy of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale
      was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there.
      Also, that in Henry VIIIth&amp;rsquo;s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a
      handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with
      barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale.
      Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is
      made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned
      and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of
      Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from
      the crown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands
      be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you
      come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes
      away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays
      partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all
      know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old
      train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips
      of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And
      this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally
      left in Greenland by a whaling vessel&amp;mdash;that these men actually lived
      for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left
      ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps
      are called &amp;ldquo;fritters&amp;rdquo;; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
      and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives&amp;rsquo; 
      dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that
      the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
      exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
      delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
      buffalo&amp;rsquo;s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
      pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is;
      like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third
      month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.
      Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other
      substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night
      it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the
      huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I
      thus made.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
      The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
      whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),
      they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in
      flavor somewhat resembling calves&amp;rsquo; head, which is quite a dish among some
      epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by
      continually dining upon calves&amp;rsquo; brains, by and by get to have a little
      brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf&amp;rsquo;s head from their own
      heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the
      reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf&amp;rsquo;s head before
      him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a
      sort of reproachfully at him, with an &amp;ldquo;Et tu Brute!&amp;rdquo; expression.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous
      that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that
      appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned:
      &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it
      too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox
      was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on
      his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved
      it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
      the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.
      Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal&amp;rsquo;s jaw? Cannibals? who
      is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
      salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
      will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
      judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest
      geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
      patÃ©-de-foie-gras.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding
      insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized
      and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle
      made of?&amp;mdash;what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are
      eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat
      goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the
      Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders
      formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two
      that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary
      toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at
      least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For
      that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed;
      and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to
      take in all sail; lash the helm a&amp;rsquo;lee; and then send every one below to
      his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,
      anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each
      couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes
      well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not
      answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the
      moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,
      little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other
      parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,
      their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by
      vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure
      notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into
      still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the
      Pequod&amp;rsquo;s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,
      to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the
      whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
      concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on
      deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately
      suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,
      so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two
      mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant
      murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep into their
      skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of
      their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their
      mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of
      the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other&amp;rsquo;s disembowelments,
      but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
      seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely
      voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with
      the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or
      Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after
      what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted
      on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his
      murderous jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is
      about the bigness of a man&amp;rsquo;s spread hand; and in general shape,
      corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
      sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the
      lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being
      used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff
      pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Queequeg no care what god made him shark,&amp;rdquo; said the savage, agonizingly
      lifting his hand up and down; &amp;ldquo;wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de
      god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
      professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
      turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have
      thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
      things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which
      no single man can possibly lift&amp;mdash;this vast bunch of grapes was swayed
      up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest
      point anywhere above a ship&amp;rsquo;s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope
      winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and
      the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this
      block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
      attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
      the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body
      for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.
      This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is
      inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now
      commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the
      entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the
      nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and
      nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to
      the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is
      heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the
      whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the
      disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the
      blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it
      stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by
      spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass
      continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the
      blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the
      &amp;ldquo;scarf,&amp;rdquo; simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the
      mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
      act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till
      its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease
      heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways
      to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take
      good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch
      him headlong overboard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
      called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out
      a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole,
      the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to
      retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows.
      Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off,
      once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong,
      desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while
      the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
      blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers
      forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and
      hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened
      away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right
      beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this
      twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
      blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And
      thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
      simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the
      blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining,
      and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general
      friction.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of
      the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
      afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains
      unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know
      what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,
      close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from
      eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature&amp;rsquo;s
      skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of
      fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot
      raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale&amp;rsquo;s body but that same
      blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably
      dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of
      the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin,
      transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of
      isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,
      previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but
      becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I
      use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and
      being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with
      fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to
      read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I
      am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass
      substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so
      much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin,
      so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
      the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
      new-born child. But no more of this.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as
      in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
      hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or
      rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,
      and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of
      the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
      integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to
      the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of
      the stuff of the whale&amp;rsquo;s skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the
      many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
      crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
      something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon
      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford
      the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,
      if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
      connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm
      Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old
      Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the
      banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the
      mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian
      rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which
      the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back,
      and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular
      linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an
      irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the
      sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping
      contact with vast floating icebergs&amp;mdash;I should say, that those rocks
      must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also
      seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile
      contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
      full-grown bulls of the species.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
      whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy
      and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a
      real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over
      his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy
      blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
      comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
      become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
      North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found
      exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,
      are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are
      refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an
      iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas,
      like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he
      dies. How wonderful is it then&amp;mdash;except after explanation&amp;mdash;that
      this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is
      to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his
      lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,
      they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into
      the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more
      surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood
      of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
      the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this
      world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at
      the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s, and like the great whale,
      retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
      how few are domed like St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s! of creatures, how few vast as the
      whale!

      CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!&amp;rdquo;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
      beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it
      has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it
      floats more and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the
      insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of
      screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the
      whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the
      ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks
      and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours
      from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the
      unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
      wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on,
      till lost in infinite perspectives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There&amp;rsquo;s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
      pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In
      life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure
      he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do
      pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest
      whale is free.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives
      and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering
      discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming
      fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and
      the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale&amp;rsquo;s unharming
      corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;shoals, rocks,
      and breakers hereabouts: beware!&lt;/i&gt; And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships
      shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
      their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There&amp;rsquo;s your
      law of precedents; there&amp;rsquo;s your utility of traditions; there&amp;rsquo;s the story
      of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and
      now not even hovering in the air! There&amp;rsquo;s orthodoxy!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus, while in life the great whale&amp;rsquo;s body may have been a real terror to
      his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the
      Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.

      CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the
      body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm
      Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale
      surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on
      the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very
      place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must
      operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his
      subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and
      oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under
      these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh;
      and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single
      peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer
      clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at
      a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel,
      then, at Stubb&amp;rsquo;s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm
      whale?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
      till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is
      hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown
      leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s head embraces nearly
      one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as
      that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing
      as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers&amp;rsquo; scales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Pequod&amp;rsquo;s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
      hoisted against the ship&amp;rsquo;s side&amp;mdash;about half way out of the sea, so
      that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
      there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the
      enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on
      that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
      blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s waist like the giant Holofernes&amp;rsquo;s
      from the girdle of Judith.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
      below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now
      deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was
      more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from
      his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over
      the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb&amp;rsquo;s long
      spade&amp;mdash;still remaining there after the whale&amp;rsquo;s decapitation&amp;mdash;and
      striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its
      other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes
      attentively fixed on this head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
      intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx&amp;rsquo;s in the desert. &amp;ldquo;Speak, thou vast
      and venerable head,&amp;rdquo; muttered Ahab, &amp;ldquo;which, though ungarnished with a
      beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head,
      and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast
      dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has
      moved amid this world&amp;rsquo;s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies
      rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this
      frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there,
      in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been
      where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor&amp;rsquo;s side, where
      sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw&amp;rsquo;st the
      locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they
      sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed
      false to them. Thou saw&amp;rsquo;st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from
      the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the
      insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed&amp;mdash;while
      swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a
      righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen
      enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one
      syllable is thine!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sail ho!&amp;rdquo; cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye? Well, now, that&amp;rsquo;s cheering,&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself,
      while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. &amp;ldquo;That lively cry
      upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.&amp;mdash;Where
      away?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to
      us!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and
      to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how
      far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom
      stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam&amp;rsquo;s Story.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the
      ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By and by, through the glass the stranger&amp;rsquo;s boats and manned mast-heads
      proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting
      by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not
      hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be
      made.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
      the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals
      being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
      attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders
      are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable
      distances and with no small facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Pequod&amp;rsquo;s signal was at last responded to by the stranger&amp;rsquo;s setting her
      own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her
      yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s lee, and lowered a
      boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by
      Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in
      question waved his hand from his boat&amp;rsquo;s stern in token of that proceeding
      being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a
      malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of
      infecting the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s company. For, though himself and boat&amp;rsquo;s crew
      remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an
      incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously
      adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to
      come into direct contact with the Pequod.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
      interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam&amp;rsquo;s
      boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
      Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew
      very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the
      sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way
      ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again.
      Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
      conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not
      without still another interruption of a very different sort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam&amp;rsquo;s boat, was a man of a singular appearance,
      even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all
      totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his
      face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted,
      cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the
      overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep,
      settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s
      he! that&amp;rsquo;s he!&amp;mdash;the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho&amp;rsquo;s company told
      us of!&amp;rdquo; Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a
      certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the
      Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it
      seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency
      over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,
      was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having
      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning
      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and
      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam&amp;rsquo;s whaling
      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship&amp;rsquo;s getting out of
      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself
      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He
      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of
      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching
      earnestness with which he declared these things;&amp;mdash;the dark, daring
      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural
      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of
      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.
      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much
      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
      apprised that that individual&amp;rsquo;s intention was to land him in the first
      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials&amp;mdash;devoting
      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention
      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the
      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if
      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was
      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to
      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass
      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all
      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole
      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The
      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;
      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,
      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they
      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
      return to the Pequod.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I fear not thy epidemic, man,&amp;rdquo; said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
      Mayhew, who stood in the boat&amp;rsquo;s stern; &amp;ldquo;come on board.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But now Gabriel started to his feet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
      plague!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Gabriel! Gabriel!&amp;rdquo; cried Captain Mayhew; &amp;ldquo;thou must either&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; But
      that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
      drowned all speech.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast thou seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo; demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
      back.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible
      tail!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I tell thee again, Gabriel, that&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; But again the boat tore ahead as
      if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
      succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
      caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted
      sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen
      eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature
      seemed to warrant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning
      Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,
      whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued
      with him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a
      whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby
      Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,
      Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in
      case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing
      the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the
      Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby
      Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned
      with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling
      to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel&amp;rsquo;s denunciations
      and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
      With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous,
      unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast.
      Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one
      arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to
      the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate,
      was standing up in his boat&amp;rsquo;s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his
      tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to
      get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from
      the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out
      of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
      furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in
      his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a
      chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman&amp;rsquo;s head; but the
      mate for ever sank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
      Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
      Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener
      the boat&amp;rsquo;s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman
      stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest of
      all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body
      has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible; the man
      being stark dead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
      from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;The vial! the vial!&amp;rdquo;
       Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
      the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;
      because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
      fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
      one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
      wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
      that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended
      to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab
      answered&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Aye.&amp;rdquo; Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his
      feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward
      pointed finger&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Think, think of the blasphemer&amp;mdash;dead, and down
      there!&amp;mdash;beware of the blasphemer&amp;rsquo;s end!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, &amp;ldquo;Captain, I have just
      bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers,
      if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
      whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon
      the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most
      letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining
      an age of two or three years or more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,
      damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of
      being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself
      might well have been the post-boy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;st not read it?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it&amp;rsquo;s but a
      dim scrawl;&amp;mdash;what&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo; As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
      long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
      insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its
      coming any closer to the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, &amp;ldquo;Mr. Har&amp;mdash;yes, Mr. Harry&amp;mdash;(a
      woman&amp;rsquo;s pinny hand,&amp;mdash;the man&amp;rsquo;s wife, I&amp;rsquo;ll wager)&amp;mdash;Aye&amp;mdash;Mr.
      Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;&amp;mdash;why it&amp;rsquo;s Macey, and he&amp;rsquo;s dead!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,&amp;rdquo; sighed Mayhew; &amp;ldquo;but let me
      have it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nay, keep it thyself,&amp;rdquo; cried Gabriel to Ahab; &amp;ldquo;thou art soon going that
      way.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Curses throttle thee!&amp;rdquo; yelled Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
      receive it&amp;rdquo;; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s hands, he caught
      it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as
      he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted
      a little towards the ship&amp;rsquo;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter
      suddenly ranged along with Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s eager hand. He clutched it in an
      instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it
      thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&amp;rsquo;s feet. Then Gabriel
      shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that
      manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of
      the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
      affair.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there
      is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are
      wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in
      any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done
      everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of
      the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that
      upon first breaking ground in the whale&amp;rsquo;s back, the blubber-hook was
      inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But
      how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that
      hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty
      it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&amp;rsquo;s back for the special
      purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that
      the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or
      stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost
      entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down
      there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer
      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass
      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,
      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume&amp;mdash;a shirt and socks&amp;mdash;in
      which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one
      had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Being the savage&amp;rsquo;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in
      his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend
      upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&amp;rsquo;s
      back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long
      cord. Just so, from the ship&amp;rsquo;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there
      in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope,
      attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
      proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
      ends; fast to Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather
      one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded;
      and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor
      demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his
      wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my
      own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous
      liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that
      while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that
      my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that
      my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another&amp;rsquo;s mistake or
      misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.
      Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for
      its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet
      still further pondering&amp;mdash;while I jerked him now and then from between
      the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him&amp;mdash;still further
      pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise
      situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way
      or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If
      your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you
      poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding
      caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil
      chances of life. But handle Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
      sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor
      could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management
      of one end of it.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
      that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement
      upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in
      order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee
      for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale
      and the ship&amp;mdash;where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
      rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he
      was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
      night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
      blood which began to flow from the carcass&amp;mdash;the rabid creatures
      swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside
      with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that
      attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously
      carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous
      finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.
      Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the
      poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a
      peculiarly ferocious shark&amp;mdash;he was provided with still another
      protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
      Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades,
      wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This
      procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of
      them. They meant Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty
      zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the
      sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those
      indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a
      tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that
      great iron hook&amp;mdash;poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo,
      and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and
      then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea&amp;mdash;what matters it,
      after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in
      this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
      sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and
      spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as
      with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up
      the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the
      side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance
      hands him&amp;mdash;what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a
      cup of tepid ginger and water!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ginger? Do I smell ginger?&amp;rdquo; suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. &amp;ldquo;Yes,
      this must be ginger,&amp;rdquo; peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing
      as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished
      steward slowly saying, &amp;ldquo;Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to
      tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger
      the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering
      cannibal? Ginger!&amp;mdash;what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?&amp;mdash;lucifer
      matches?&amp;mdash;tinder?&amp;mdash;gunpowder?&amp;mdash;what the devil is ginger, I
      say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,&amp;rdquo;
       he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from
      forward. &amp;ldquo;Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you
      please.&amp;rdquo; Then watching the mate&amp;rsquo;s countenance, he added, &amp;ldquo;The steward, Mr.
      Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there,
      this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I
      ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life
      into a half-drowned man?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I trust not,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;it is poor stuff enough.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, steward,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ll teach you to drug a harpooneer;
      none of your apothecary&amp;rsquo;s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You
      have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket
      the proceeds, do ye?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was not me,&amp;rdquo; cried Dough-Boy, &amp;ldquo;it was Aunt Charity that brought the
      ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
      only this ginger-jub&amp;mdash;so she called it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the
      lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It
      is the captain&amp;rsquo;s orders&amp;mdash;grog for the harpooneer on a whale.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Enough,&amp;rdquo; replied Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;only don&amp;rsquo;t hit him again, but&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
      that sort; and this fellow&amp;rsquo;s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
      of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was
      handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity&amp;rsquo;s gift, and that was
      freely given to the waves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s
      prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s side. But we must let it continue
      hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the
      present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is
      to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted
      into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual
      tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that
      but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And
      though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior
      creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them
      at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts
      without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought
      alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made
      that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
      boats, Stubb&amp;rsquo;s and Flask&amp;rsquo;s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and
      further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the
      mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
      tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
      both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
      plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
      towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it
      seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,
      within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if
      diving under the keel. &amp;ldquo;Cut, cut!&amp;rdquo; was the cry from the ship to the boats,
      which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly
      dash against the vessel&amp;rsquo;s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs,
      and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope,
      and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the
      ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
      they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
      plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them
      under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they
      stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt
      running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping
      beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and
      quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like
      bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to
      sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale
      abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of
      the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
      circuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking
      him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus
      round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks
      that had before swum round the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s body, rushed to the fresh
      blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager
      Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten
      rock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
      turned upon his back a corpse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
      and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
      conversation ensued between them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb,
      not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a
      leviathan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wants with it?&amp;rdquo; said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat&amp;rsquo;s bow,
      &amp;ldquo;did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s head
      hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s on the
      larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards
      capsize?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why not?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and
      he seems to know all about ships&amp;rsquo; charms. But I sometimes think he&amp;rsquo;ll
      charm the ship to no good at last. I don&amp;rsquo;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did
      you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&amp;rsquo;s
      head, Stubb?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
      dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down
      there, Flask&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
      hands&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
      disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
      stowed away on board ship? He&amp;rsquo;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&amp;rsquo;t
      see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled
      away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he&amp;rsquo;s
      always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He sleeps in his boots, don&amp;rsquo;t he? He hasn&amp;rsquo;t got any hammock; but I&amp;rsquo;ve
      seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No doubt, and it&amp;rsquo;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
      see, in the eye of the rigging.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the old man have so much to do with him for?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bargain?&amp;mdash;about what?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the
      devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his
      silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he&amp;rsquo;ll
      surrender Moby Dick.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I
      tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship
      once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and
      inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked
      the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &amp;lsquo;I
      want John.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;What for?&amp;rsquo; says the old governor. &amp;lsquo;What business is that of
      yours,&amp;rsquo; says the devil, getting mad,&amp;mdash;&amp;lsquo;I want to use him.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Take
      him,&amp;rsquo; says the governor&amp;mdash;and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn&amp;rsquo;t
      give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I&amp;rsquo;ll eat
      this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp&amp;mdash;ain&amp;rsquo;t you all ready
      there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&amp;rsquo;s get the whale alongside.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I think I remember some such story as you were telling,&amp;rdquo; said Flask, when
      at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the
      ship, &amp;ldquo;but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember where.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye
      read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb,
      do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same
      you say is now on board the Pequod?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the devil live for
      ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson
      a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get
      into the admiral&amp;rsquo;s cabin, don&amp;rsquo;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole?
      Tell me that, Mr. Flask?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do you see that mainmast there?&amp;rdquo; pointing to the ship; &amp;ldquo;well, that&amp;rsquo;s the
      figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s hold, and string along
      in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t begin
      to be Fedallah&amp;rsquo;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&amp;rsquo;t show hoops
      enough to make oughts enough.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
      meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he&amp;rsquo;s
      so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for
      ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard&amp;mdash;tell me that?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Give him a good ducking, anyhow.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But he&amp;rsquo;d crawl back.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Duck him again; and keep ducking him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though&amp;mdash;yes,
      and drown you&amp;mdash;what then?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I should like to see him try it; I&amp;rsquo;d give him such a pair of black eyes
      that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare to show his face in the admiral&amp;rsquo;s cabin again for a
      long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and
      hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil,
      Flask; so you suppose I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of the devil? Who&amp;rsquo;s afraid of him, except
      the old governor who daresn&amp;rsquo;t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as
      he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a
      bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he&amp;rsquo;d roast for
      him? There&amp;rsquo;s a governor!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do I suppose it? You&amp;rsquo;ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to
      keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going
      on, I&amp;rsquo;ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say&amp;mdash;Look here,
      Beelzebub, you don&amp;rsquo;t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&amp;rsquo;ll
      make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give
      him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the
      stump&amp;mdash;do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself
      docked in that queer fashion, he&amp;rsquo;ll sneak off without the poor
      satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;&amp;mdash;what else?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
      fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I tell you so?&amp;rdquo; said Flask; &amp;ldquo;yes, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon see this right
      whale&amp;rsquo;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In good time, Flask&amp;rsquo;s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
      leaned over towards the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s head, now, by the counterpoise of
      both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
      well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke&amp;rsquo;s head, you go over
      that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&amp;rsquo;s and you come back
      again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming
      boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then
      you will float light and right.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
      ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case
      of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole,
      but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted
      on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the
      crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done.
      The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship
      not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&amp;rsquo;s head, and ever and
      anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand.
      And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while,
      if the Parsee&amp;rsquo;s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and
      lengthen Ahab&amp;rsquo;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were
      bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s Head&amp;mdash;Contrasted View.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join
      them, and lay together our own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly
      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all
      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them
      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment
      hanging from the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s side; and as we may freely go from one to the
      other, by merely stepping across the deck:&amp;mdash;where, I should like to
      know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than
      here?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s which the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s sadly
      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s head. As you behold
      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of
      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving
      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the
      fishermen technically call a &amp;ldquo;grey-headed whale.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads&amp;mdash;namely, the
      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale&amp;rsquo;s jaw, if you
      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
      fancy to be a young colt&amp;rsquo;s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
      magnitude of the head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale&amp;rsquo;s eyes, it is plain
      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he
      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale&amp;rsquo;s eyes
      corresponds to that of a man&amp;rsquo;s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how
      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.
      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision
      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more
      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with
      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more
      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have
      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man&amp;mdash;what, indeed,
      but his eyes?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the
      whale&amp;rsquo;s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid
      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes
      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which
      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one
      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;
      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man
      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with
      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are
      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the
      view. This peculiarity of the whale&amp;rsquo;s eyes is a thing always to be borne
      in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some
      subsequent scenes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
      hint. So long as a man&amp;rsquo;s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is
      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever
      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one&amp;rsquo;s experience will teach him,
      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one
      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to
      examine any two things&amp;mdash;however large or however small&amp;mdash;at one
      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and
      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and
      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one
      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other
      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,
      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
      combining, and subtle than man&amp;rsquo;s, that he can at the same moment of time
      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and
      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as
      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go
      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,
      strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset
      by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so
      common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the
      helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically
      opposite powers of vision must involve them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between
      the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external
      opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a
      membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world
      through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is
      smaller than a hare&amp;rsquo;s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of
      Herschel&amp;rsquo;s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
      hearing? Not at all.&amp;mdash;Why then do you try to &amp;ldquo;enlarge&amp;rdquo; your mind?
      Subtilize it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
      over the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by
      a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that
      the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might
      descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us
      hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really
      beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or
      rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like
      the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end,
      instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and
      expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas!
      it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall
      with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms
      down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with
      his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at
      right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship&amp;rsquo;s jib-boom. This
      whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
      hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed,
      leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his
      tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In most cases this lower jaw&amp;mdash;being easily unhinged by a practised
      artist&amp;mdash;is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
      extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white
      whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
      anchor; and when the proper time comes&amp;mdash;some few days after the other
      work&amp;mdash;Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
      dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg
      lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle
      being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
      teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled
      after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
      piled away like joists for building houses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s Head&amp;mdash;Contrasted View.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s
      head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s head may be compared to a
      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
      so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s head bears a rather inelegant
      resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old
      Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&amp;rsquo;s last. And in this
      same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming
      brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for
      an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
      sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass&amp;mdash;this green,
      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &amp;ldquo;crown,&amp;rdquo; and the Southern
      fishers the &amp;ldquo;bonnet&amp;rdquo; of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,
      you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&amp;rsquo;s nest
      in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
      here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
      unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &amp;ldquo;crown&amp;rdquo;
       also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
      thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,
      whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.
      But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a
      diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
      there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter&amp;rsquo;s measurement, about twenty feet long
      and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons
      of oil and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The
      fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important
      interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the
      beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide
      into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be
      the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah
      went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp
      angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
      arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
      scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which
      depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those
      Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges
      of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
      Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
      fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.
      In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there
      are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some
      whalemen calculate the creature&amp;rsquo;s age, as the age of an oak by its
      circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
      demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,
      if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than
      at first glance will seem reasonable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
      &amp;ldquo;whiskers&amp;rdquo; inside of the whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth;* another, &amp;ldquo;hogs&amp;rsquo; bristles&amp;rdquo;; a
      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
      &amp;ldquo;There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
      upper &lt;i&gt;chop&lt;/i&gt;, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper
      part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a
      rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As every one knows, these same &amp;ldquo;hogs&amp;rsquo; bristles,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;fins,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;whiskers,&amp;rdquo;
       &amp;ldquo;blinds,&amp;rdquo; or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long
      been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s time that the bone was in its
      glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient
      dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;
      even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly
      under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
      the same bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
      in the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
      colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you
      were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand
      pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey&amp;mdash;the
      tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very
      fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This
      particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a
      six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with&amp;mdash;that
      the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.
      To sum up, then: in the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s there is no great well of sperm; no
      ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the
      Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
      bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the
      Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
      together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
      not be very long in following.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s there? It is the same he
      died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
      away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born
      of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head&amp;rsquo;s
      expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the
      vessel&amp;rsquo;s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head
      seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This
      Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who
      might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s head, I would have you, as
      a sensible physiologist, simply&amp;mdash;particularly remark its front
      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate
      it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
      intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.
      Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this
      matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most
      appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in
      all recorded history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
      front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water;
      you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
      backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
      receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
      under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
      were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no
      external nose; and that what nose he has&amp;mdash;his spout hole&amp;mdash;is on
      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s
      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of
      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the
      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there
      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this
      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon
      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you
      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably
      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have
      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind
      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about
      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,
      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed
      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently
      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were
      paved with horses&amp;rsquo; hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there
      a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest
      of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have
      snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this
      sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to
      this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
      what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension
      or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such
      provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in
      which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon
      swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed
      elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head;
      it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical
      lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
      destructive of all elements contributes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
      and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of
      tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is&amp;mdash;by
      the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So
      that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and
      concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;
      when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I
      trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to
      abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the
      Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not
      elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are
      but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing
      for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the
      provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread
      goddess&amp;rsquo;s veil at Lais?

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
      upon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Regarding the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is
      the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
      wall of a thick tendinous substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
      sides.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated
      cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
      upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh
      Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically
      carved in front, so the whale&amp;rsquo;s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable
      strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
      Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most
      excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
      contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
      highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous
      state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
      the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
      exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
      forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is
      just forming in water. A large whale&amp;rsquo;s case generally yields about five
      hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
      considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise
      irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly
      have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of
      a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since&amp;mdash;as
      has been elsewhere set forth&amp;mdash;the head embraces one third of the
      whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
      of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship&amp;rsquo;s
      side.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As in decapitating the whale, the operator&amp;rsquo;s instrument is brought close
      to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
      magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
      untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
      invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
      is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the
      enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make
      quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and&amp;mdash;in
      this particular instance&amp;mdash;almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
      Whale&amp;rsquo;s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part
      where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a
      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling
      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down
      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and
      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,
      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit
      of the head. There&amp;mdash;still high elevated above the rest of the
      company, to whom he vivaciously cries&amp;mdash;he seems some Turkish Muezzin
      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for
      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he
      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this
      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert
      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom
      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into
      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it
      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up
      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid&amp;rsquo;s pail of new milk.
      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by
      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting
      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
      yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder
      and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of
      the pole have gone down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
      queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
      was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold
      on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place
      where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One
      himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
      reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as
      the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up&amp;mdash;my God! poor
      Tashtego&amp;mdash;like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
      dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a
      horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Man overboard!&amp;rdquo; cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
      came to his senses. &amp;ldquo;Swing the bucket this way!&amp;rdquo; and putting one foot into
      it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself,
      the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before
      Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a
      terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head
      throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment
      seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian
      unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he
      had sunk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the
      whip&amp;mdash;which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles&amp;mdash;a
      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one
      of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast
      vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and
      shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the
      entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of
      giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the
      head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come down, come down!&amp;rdquo; yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would
      still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed
      down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried
      harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In heaven&amp;rsquo;s name, man,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;are you ramming home a cartridge
      there?&amp;mdash;Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket
      on top of his head? Avast, will ye!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stand clear of the tackle!&amp;rdquo; cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped
      into the sea, like Niagara&amp;rsquo;s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly
      relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and
      all caught their breath, as half swinging&amp;mdash;now over the sailors&amp;rsquo; 
      heads, and now over the water&amp;mdash;Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,
      was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
      But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with
      a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over
      the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had
      dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye
      counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the
      sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat
      alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ha! ha!&amp;rdquo; cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
      forth from the grass over a grave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Both! both!&amp;mdash;it is both!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;cried Daggoo again with a joyful
      shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one
      hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into
      the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges
      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his
      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out
      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a
      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,
      and might occasion great trouble;&amp;mdash;he had thrust back the leg, and by
      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so
      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way&amp;mdash;head
      foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be
      expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
      the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
      accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
      hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
      Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
      riding and rowing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header&amp;rsquo;s will be sure to seem
      incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen
      or heard of some one&amp;rsquo;s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which
      not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian&amp;rsquo;s,
      considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s
      well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a
      far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all,
      but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly
      emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous
      wall of the well&amp;mdash;a double welded, hammered substance, as I have
      before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in
      it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance
      was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of
      the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
      deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his
      agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running
      delivery, so it was.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and
      sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
      recalled&amp;mdash;the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
      honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,
      that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato&amp;rsquo;s honey head, and sweetly
      perished there?

      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as
      yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
      Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for
      Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.
      Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various
      faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds,
      serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of
      expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim
      failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics
      of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a
      pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I
      will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous
      of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls
      their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as
      an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the
      whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower
      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the
      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated
      open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias&amp;rsquo;s marble Jove,
      and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a
      magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency
      which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.
      Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been
      impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head
      in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by
      the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
      royal beadle on his throne.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be
      had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect
      is sublime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
      touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
      elephant&amp;rsquo;s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that
      great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It
      signifies&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;God: done this day by my hand.&amp;rdquo; But in most creatures,
      nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land
      lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s
      or Melancthon&amp;rsquo;s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves
      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the
      forehead&amp;rsquo;s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending
      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that
      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly
      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one
      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,
      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad
      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the
      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous
      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon
      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
      depression in the forehead&amp;rsquo;s middle, which, in man, is Lavater&amp;rsquo;s mark of
      genius.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical
      silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to
      the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian
      thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is
      tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so
      exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any
      highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the
      merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now
      egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to
      Jove&amp;rsquo;s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no
      Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man&amp;rsquo;s and every being&amp;rsquo;s face.
      Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If
      then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the
      simplest peasant&amp;rsquo;s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how
      may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s
      brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.

      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
      brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in
      length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the
      side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.
      But in life&amp;mdash;as we have elsewhere seen&amp;mdash;this inclined plane is
      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater&amp;mdash;in
      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth&amp;mdash;reposes
      the mere handful of this monster&amp;rsquo;s brain. The brain is at least twenty
      feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast
      outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications
      of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have
      known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any
      other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards
      of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions,
      to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his
      general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his
      intelligence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the
      creature&amp;rsquo;s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true
      brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,
      like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of
      its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance
      to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point
      of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human
      magnitude) among a plate of men&amp;rsquo;s skulls, and you would involuntarily
      confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its
      summit, in phrenological phrase you would say&amp;mdash;This man had no
      self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along
      with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best
      form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception
      of what the most exalted potency is.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale&amp;rsquo;s proper brain, you
      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped&amp;rsquo;s spine, you will
      be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrÃ¦ to a strung necklace of
      dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It
      is a German conceit, that the vertebrÃ¦ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.
      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the
      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrÃ¦ of which he was
      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I
      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not
      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.
      For I believe that much of a man&amp;rsquo;s character will be found betokened in
      his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you
      are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I
      rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
      fling half out to the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight
      in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it
      passes through the remaining vertebrÃ¦ the canal tapers in size, but for a
      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this
      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance&amp;mdash;the
      spinal cord&amp;mdash;as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.
      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain&amp;rsquo;s
      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to
      that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable
      to survey and map out the whale&amp;rsquo;s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in
      this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
      more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal
      cord.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would
      merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm
      Whale&amp;rsquo;s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the
      larger vertebrÃ¦, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould
      of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the
      organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the
      great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick
      De Deer, master, of Bremen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals
      of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in
      the Pacific.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
      bows instead of the stern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What has he in his hand there?&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, pointing to something
      wavingly held by the German. &amp;ldquo;Impossible!&amp;mdash;a lamp-feeder!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not that,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, &amp;ldquo;no, no, it&amp;rsquo;s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he&amp;rsquo;s
      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don&amp;rsquo;t you see that big
      tin can there alongside of him?&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s his boiling water. Oh! he&amp;rsquo;s
      all right, is the Yarman.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Go along with you,&amp;rdquo; cried Flask, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He&amp;rsquo;s
      out of oil, and has come a-begging.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
      what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced
      his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
      conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching
      his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&amp;mdash;his
      last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet
      captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was
      indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a &lt;i&gt;clean&lt;/i&gt; one (that is, an
      empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
      ship&amp;rsquo;s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round
      his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
      that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s keels.
      There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were
      going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their
      flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a
      great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment
      upon the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
      old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the
      unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
      jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod
      in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such
      venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their
      wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the
      white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell
      formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and
      laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
      in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
      seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters
      behind him to upbubble.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s got some paregoric?&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, &amp;ldquo;he has the stomach-ache, I&amp;rsquo;m
      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds
      are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It&amp;rsquo;s the first foul wind I ever
      knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must
      be, he&amp;rsquo;s lost his tiller.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
      of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so
      did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning
      over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the
      unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in
      battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Only wait a bit, old chap, and I&amp;rsquo;ll give ye a sling for that wounded
      arm,&amp;rdquo; cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Mind he don&amp;rsquo;t sling thee with it,&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck. &amp;ldquo;Give way, or the
      German will have him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable
      whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with
      such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At
      this juncture the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s keels had shot by the three German boats last
      lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick&amp;rsquo;s boat still led the
      chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing
      they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be
      enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass
      him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
      and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
      other boats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The ungracious and ungrateful dog!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck; &amp;ldquo;he mocks and dares
      me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;then
      in his old intense whisper&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I tell ye what it is, men&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;cried Stubb to his crew&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s
      against my religion to get mad; but I&amp;rsquo;d like to eat that villainous Yarman&amp;mdash;Pull&amp;mdash;won&amp;rsquo;t
      ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead
      of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don&amp;rsquo;t some of ye burst a
      blood-vessel? Who&amp;rsquo;s that been dropping an anchor overboard&amp;mdash;we don&amp;rsquo;t
      budge an inch&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re becalmed. Halloo, here&amp;rsquo;s grass growing in the
      boat&amp;rsquo;s bottom&amp;mdash;and by the Lord, the mast there&amp;rsquo;s budding. This won&amp;rsquo;t
      do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye
      spit fire or not?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! see the suds he makes!&amp;rdquo; cried Flask, dancing up and down&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;What
      a hump&amp;mdash;Oh, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; pile on the beef&amp;mdash;lays like a log! Oh! my lads,
      &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; spring&amp;mdash;slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads&amp;mdash;baked
      clams and muffins&amp;mdash;oh, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;, spring,&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s a hundred barreller&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t
      lose him now&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t oh, &lt;i&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;see that Yarman&amp;mdash;Oh, won&amp;rsquo;t
      ye pull for your duff, my lads&amp;mdash;such a sog! such a sogger! Don&amp;rsquo;t ye
      love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!&amp;mdash;a bank!&amp;mdash;a
      whole bank! The bank of England!&amp;mdash;Oh, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;do!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;What&amp;rsquo;s that
      Yarman about now?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
      retarding his rivals&amp;rsquo; way, and at the same time economically accelerating
      his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The unmannerly Dutch dogger!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb. &amp;ldquo;Pull now, men, like fifty
      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d&amp;rsquo;ye say,
      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for
      the honor of old Gayhead? What d&amp;rsquo;ye say?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I say, pull like god-dam,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;cried the Indian.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,
      occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, &amp;ldquo;There
      she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!
      Sail over him!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their
      gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a
      righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of
      his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his
      white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick&amp;rsquo;s boat was nigh to capsizing,
      and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;&amp;mdash;that was a good
      time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal
      start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German&amp;rsquo;s quarter. An
      instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale&amp;rsquo;s
      immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming
      swell that he made.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
      going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented
      jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to
      this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
      every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways
      rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with
      clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving
      to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with
      plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb
      brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
      save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the
      sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,
      portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the
      stoutest man who so pitied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s boats
      the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to
      hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the
      last chance would for ever escape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
      tigers&amp;mdash;Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo&amp;mdash;instinctively sprang to
      their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale&amp;rsquo;s headlong
      rush, bumped the German&amp;rsquo;s aside with such force, that both Derick and his
      baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
      keels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid, my butter-boxes,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
      upon them as he shot by; &amp;ldquo;ye&amp;rsquo;ll be picked up presently&amp;mdash;all right&amp;mdash;I
      saw some sharks astern&amp;mdash;St. Bernard&amp;rsquo;s dogs, you know&amp;mdash;relieve
      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
      sunbeam! Hurrah!&amp;mdash;Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury
      on a plain&amp;mdash;makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him
      that way; and there&amp;rsquo;s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
      hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he&amp;rsquo;s going to Davy Jones&amp;mdash;all
      a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the
      everlasting mail!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the monster&amp;rsquo;s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the
      loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so
      fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust
      the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated
      smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last&amp;mdash;owing to the
      perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the
      three ropes went straight down into the blue&amp;mdash;the gunwales of the
      bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high
      in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
      remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the
      position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and
      lost in this way, yet it is this &amp;ldquo;holding on,&amp;rdquo; as it is called; this
      hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is
      that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp
      lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
      doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
      to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more
      he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him&amp;mdash;in a
      full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet&amp;mdash;the
      pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing
      atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,
      in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a
      column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight
      of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
      twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
      board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into
      its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,
      not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
      would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the
      utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight
      inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible
      that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the
      big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of
      board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Canst
      thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The
      sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the
      habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;
      darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!&amp;rdquo; This
      the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
      For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
      his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      fish-spears!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
      down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to
      shade half Xerxes&amp;rsquo; army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale
      must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stand by, men; he stirs,&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
      scared from it into the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Haul in! Haul in!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck again; &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s rising.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand&amp;rsquo;s breadth
      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship&amp;rsquo;s
      lengths of the hunters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
      there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
      when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
      certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it
      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that
      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at
      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by
      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,
      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is
      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable
      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the
      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and
      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from
      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,
      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
      significantly call it, was untouched.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
      form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
      His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
      strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when
      prostrate, so from the points which the whale&amp;rsquo;s eyes had once occupied,
      now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was
      none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must
      die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other
      merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that
      preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his
      blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or
      protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A nice spot,&amp;rdquo; cried Flask; &amp;ldquo;just let me prick him there once.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s no need of that!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous
      jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable
      anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly
      darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over
      with showers of gore, capsizing Flask&amp;rsquo;s boat and marring the bows. It was
      his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,
      that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on
      his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over
      slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his
      belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring
      spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
      mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
      spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground&amp;mdash;so the last long dying
      spout of the whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
      by Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
      that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
      few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the
      ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly
      secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless
      artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the
      entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on
      the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
      harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with
      the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to
      denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other
      unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration
      alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone
      being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm
      about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been
      darted by some Nor&amp;rsquo; West Indian long before America was discovered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
      there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by
      the ship&amp;rsquo;s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing
      to the body&amp;rsquo;s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,
      who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it
      so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been
      capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when
      the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
      strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were
      fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in
      the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like
      walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.
      Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from
      their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows
      were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift
      from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the
      submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole
      tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed
      on the point of going over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hold on, hold on, won&amp;rsquo;t ye?&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb to the body, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t be in such a
      devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for
      it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of
      ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Knife? Aye, aye,&amp;rdquo; cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter&amp;rsquo;s heavy
      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at
      the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,
      when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every
      fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
      is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted
      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its
      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales
      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might
      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon
      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of
      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest
      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the
      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
      these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his
      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,
      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again
      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases
      are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort
      of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
      In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
      Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
      of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for
      it when it shall have ascended again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
      the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
      her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
      belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible
      power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back&amp;rsquo;s spout is so similar to the
      Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
      And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this
      unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young
      keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,
      hopeful chase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
      method.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to
      the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great
      honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great
      demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have
      shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I
      myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the
      eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by
      our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the
      knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the
      distressed, and not to fill men&amp;rsquo;s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine
      story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of
      a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the
      very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly
      advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It
      was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers
      of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
      dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,
      now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood
      for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city&amp;rsquo;s legends and
      all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that
      Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to
      Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in
      this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda&amp;mdash;indeed, by some
      supposed to be indirectly derived from it&amp;mdash;is that famous story of
      St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;
      for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled
      together, and often stand for each other. &amp;ldquo;Thou art as a lion of the
      waters, and as a dragon of the sea,&amp;rdquo; saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly
      meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word
      itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had
      St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of
      doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake,
      but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to
      march boldly up to a whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on
      land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of
      those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and
      considering that as in Perseus&amp;rsquo; case, St. George&amp;rsquo;s whale might have
      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with
      the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this
      so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,
      placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare
      like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name;
      who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse&amp;rsquo;s head and both the
      palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
      him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is
      the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of
      Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And
      therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I
      venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron),
      let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen
      frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George&amp;rsquo;s
      decoration than they.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained
      dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique
      Crockett and Kit Carson&amp;mdash;that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds,
      was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly
      makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he
      ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.
      Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate
      the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our
      clan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules
      and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient
      Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versÃ¢; certainly they are
      very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
      kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
      short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to
      be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of
      the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine
      Vishnoo himself for our Lord;&amp;mdash;Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
      earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
      When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
      the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
      Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
      perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning
      the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the
      shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at
      the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and
      sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.
      Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is
      called a horseman?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there&amp;rsquo;s a member-roll
      for you! What club but the whaleman&amp;rsquo;s can head off like that?

      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
      preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical
      story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
      and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,
      equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the
      dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
      traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman&amp;rsquo;s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
      story was this:&amp;mdash;He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
      Jonah&amp;rsquo;s whale with two spouts in his head&amp;mdash;a peculiarity only true
      with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying,
      &amp;ldquo;A penny roll would choke him&amp;rdquo;; his swallow is so very small. But, to
      this, Bishop Jebb&amp;rsquo;s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,
      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale&amp;rsquo;s belly,
      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems
      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth
      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
      players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow
      tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want
      of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale&amp;rsquo;s gastric juices. But
      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt;
      whale&amp;mdash;even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been
      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown
      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to
      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I
      would add, possibly called &amp;ldquo;The Whale,&amp;rdquo; as some craft are nowadays
      christened the &amp;ldquo;Shark,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Gull,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Eagle.&amp;rdquo; Nor have there been
      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the
      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver&amp;mdash;an inflated bag of wind&amp;mdash;which
      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor
      Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another
      reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was
      swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he
      was vomited up somewhere within three days&amp;rsquo; journey of Nineveh, a city on
      the Tigris, very much more than three days&amp;rsquo; journey across from the
      nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
      short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way
      of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the
      whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf
      and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
      circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
      waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim
      in. Besides, this idea of Jonah&amp;rsquo;s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so
      early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland
      from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history
      a liar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish
      pride of reason&amp;mdash;a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that
      he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and
      the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable,
      devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese
      Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah&amp;rsquo;s going to Nineveh via the Cape
      of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general
      miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks
      devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three
      centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris&amp;rsquo;s Voyages, speaks of a
      Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous
      lamp that burnt without any oil.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed;
      and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation
      upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as
      such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible
      advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a
      sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide
      bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning
      not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than
      customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it
      hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently
      seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft&amp;rsquo;s bald keel. He seemed to
      be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain
      unwarranted by the event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,
      as of Cleopatra&amp;rsquo;s barges from Actium.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb&amp;rsquo;s was foremost. By great
      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.
      What then remained?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
      none exceed that fine manÅuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is
      only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and
      feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately
      darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.
      Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in
      length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
      lighter material&amp;mdash;pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a
      warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand
      after darting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the
      harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom
      done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of
      the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the
      lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,
      therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling
      comes into play.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in
      pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
      Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length
      to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of
      the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving
      the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband&amp;rsquo;s
      middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily
      depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the
      weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He
      minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next
      moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright
      steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the
      whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That drove the spigot out of him!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb. &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;Tis July&amp;rsquo;s immortal
      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans
      whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad,
      I&amp;rsquo;d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we&amp;rsquo;d drink round it! Yea,
      verily, hearts alive, we&amp;rsquo;d brew choice punch in the spread of his
      spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the
      spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The
      agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the
      pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the
      monster die.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That for six thousand years&amp;mdash;and no one knows how many millions of
      ages before&amp;mdash;the great whales should have been spouting all over the
      sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
      many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,
      watching these sprinklings and spoutings&amp;mdash;that all this should be,
      and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes
      past one o&amp;rsquo;clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it
      should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,
      really water, or nothing but vapor&amp;mdash;this is surely a noteworthy
      thing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,
      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined
      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to
      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human
      being&amp;rsquo;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the
      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the
      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth is buried at least eight
      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and
      this is on the top of his head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable
      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,
      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to
      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I
      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it
      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,
      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a
      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who
      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling
      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between
      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when
      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So
      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a
      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and
      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in &lt;i&gt;having his spoutings out&lt;/i&gt;, as
      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising
      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time
      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then
      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his
      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,
      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,
      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
      whale&amp;rsquo;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not
      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a
      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In man, breathing is incessantly going on&amp;mdash;one breath only serving
      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I
      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to
      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two
      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But
      owing to the mystery of the spout&amp;mdash;whether it be water or whether it
      be vapor&amp;mdash;no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this
      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
      Cologne-water in the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
      canal, and as that long canal&amp;mdash;like the grand Erie Canal&amp;mdash;is
      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has
      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely
      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to
      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for
      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just
      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this
      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side
      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a
      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the
      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed
      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It
      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;
      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm
      Whale&amp;rsquo;s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You
      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell
      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle
      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of
      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be
      undecided as to what it is precisely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,
      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around
      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops
      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely
      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is
      countersunk into the summit of the whale&amp;rsquo;s head? For even when tranquilly
      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump
      sun-dried as a dromedary&amp;rsquo;s in the desert; even then, the whale always
      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you
      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often
      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing
      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with
      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I
      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among
      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet
      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the
      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout
      alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other
      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the
      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no
      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is
      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads
      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,
      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible
      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a
      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my
      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for
      the above supposition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
      contemplations, and that vapor&amp;mdash;as you will sometimes see it&amp;mdash;glorified
      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,
      d&amp;rsquo;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.
      And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine
      intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And
      for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or
      denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
      earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
      neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with
      equal eye.

      CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and
      the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I
      celebrate a tail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s tail to begin at that point of
      the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon
      its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The
      compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or
      flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the
      crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede
      from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living
      thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the
      crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full
      grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into
      it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:&amp;mdash;upper,
      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and
      horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise
      between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything
      else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the
      middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles
      always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the
      antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of
      the masonry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the
      whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular
      fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running
      down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute
      to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the
      whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to
      matter, this were the thing to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor does this&amp;mdash;its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
      graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates
      through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their
      most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,
      strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that
      all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its
      charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
      naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
      man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God
      the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they
      may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
      hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
      successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
      brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one
      of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the
      peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
      wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be
      in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no
      fairy&amp;rsquo;s arm can transcend it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
      progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
      Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan&amp;rsquo;s tail acts in a
      different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
      wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
      whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
      which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
      furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights
      another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts
      with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a
      boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only
      inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially
      if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs
      of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it;
      but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to
      the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials,
      a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
      generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often
      received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child&amp;rsquo;s play. Some
      one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the
      sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a
      delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant&amp;rsquo;s trunk.
      This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in
      maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his
      immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he
      feel but a sailor&amp;rsquo;s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What
      tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any
      prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes&amp;rsquo; elephant
      that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented
      nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than
      one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue
      in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
      in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of
      his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great
      gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor
      from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was
      the smoke from the touch-hole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie
      considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of
      sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps,
      his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect
      in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot
      out of view. Excepting the sublime &lt;i&gt;breach&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;somewhere else to be
      described&amp;mdash;this peaking of the whale&amp;rsquo;s flukes is perhaps the grandest
      sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
      profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
      highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth
      his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing
      at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean,
      the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.
      Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky
      and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading
      towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.
      As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of
      the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire
      worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I
      then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
      beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity
      often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest
      silence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant,
      so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other
      are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an
      equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For
      as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with
      Leviathan&amp;rsquo;s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful
      blow from the elephant&amp;rsquo;s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared
      with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale&amp;rsquo;s ponderous
      flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire
      boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian
      juggler tosses his balls.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
      the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant
      stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the
      elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
      similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant
      will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet
      it forth in a stream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability
      to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would
      well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive
      herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have
      heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;
      that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the
      world. Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general
      body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced
      assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him
      not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
      understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has
      none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face
      shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and
      hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
      the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In
      a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra,
      Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or
      rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long
      unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.
      This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of
      ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and
      Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the
      west, emerge into the China seas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
      midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
      promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to
      the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering
      the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and
      ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched,
      it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the
      very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however
      ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The
      shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering
      fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and
      the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
      obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
      ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have
      passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the
      costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial
      like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low
      shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels
      sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of
      their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have
      received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs
      has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we
      occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in those waters,
      have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
      Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence,
      cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by
      the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far
      coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these
      means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm
      Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line
      in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit,
      firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most
      known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be
      presumed to be haunting it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
      drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the
      circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no
      sustenance but what&amp;rsquo;s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler.
      While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to
      foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but
      herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake&amp;rsquo;s
      contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not
      altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years&amp;rsquo; water
      in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
      the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
      fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
      streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from
      New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in
      all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having
      seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry
      them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Well,
      boys, here&amp;rsquo;s the ark!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,
      in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the
      ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more
      upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to
      keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed
      on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was
      snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing
      all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh
      entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,
      and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
      of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
      instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
      former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
      embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous
      nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance
      and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense
      caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising
      grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without
      being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
      sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
      drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the
      Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising
      and falling away to leeward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Seen from the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the
      sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,
      and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the
      thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy
      autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
      even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
      the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
      swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
      their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended
      boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through
      these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental
      seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could
      tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not
      temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the
      coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on
      stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a
      sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to
      something in our wake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
      It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something
      like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
      go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling
      his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying,
      &amp;ldquo;Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;&amp;mdash;Malays,
      sir, and after us!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly
      have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit,
      to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with
      a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these
      tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen
      pursuit,&amp;mdash;mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As
      with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn
      beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty
      pirates chasing &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he
      glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was
      then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
      his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both
      chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd
      of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally
      cheering him on with their curses;&amp;mdash;when all these conceits had
      passed through his brain, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the
      black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being
      able to drag the firm thing from its place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
      after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at
      last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging
      at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to
      grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to
      rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But
      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating
      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,
      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by
      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
      the three keels that were after them,&amp;mdash;though as yet a mile in their
      rear,&amp;mdash;than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
      battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked
      bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after
      several hours&amp;rsquo; pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a
      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert
      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say
      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto
      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;
      and like King Porus&amp;rsquo; elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast
      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their
      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.
      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,
      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged
      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of
      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could
      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding
      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have
      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when
      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre&amp;rsquo;s pit, they will, at the
      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before
      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet
      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes&amp;rsquo; time,
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in
      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for
      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale
      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed
      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the
      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags
      you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect
      life and only exist in a delirious throb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the
      crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a
      ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their
      complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be
      locked in and crushed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from
      this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from
      that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,
      Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way
      whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to
      make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty
      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting
      part of the business. &amp;ldquo;Out of the way, Commodore!&amp;rdquo; cried one, to a great
      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant
      threatened to swamp us. &amp;ldquo;Hard down with your tail, there!&amp;rdquo; cried a second
      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself
      with his own fan-like extremity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by
      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal
      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other&amp;rsquo;s grain
      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the
      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can
      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales
      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than
      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day
      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you
      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these
      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of
      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales
      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of
      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and
      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the
      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in
      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
      boat&amp;rsquo;s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came
      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts
      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not
      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale&amp;rsquo;s way greatly diminished;
      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference
      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last
      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;
      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between
      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain
      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the
      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In
      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,
      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in
      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they
      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted
      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw
      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and
      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder
      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density
      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed
      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall
      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of
      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the
      women and children of this routed host.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any
      one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the
      whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.
      At any rate&amp;mdash;though indeed such a test at such a time might be
      deceptive&amp;mdash;spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked
      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had
      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;
      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales&amp;mdash;now
      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake&amp;mdash;evinced
      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic
      which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came
      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it
      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg
      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but
      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in
      those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly
      and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives
      at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
      spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;&amp;mdash;even so did
      the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
      we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
      sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
      infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He
      was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
      from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
      reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the
      unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar&amp;rsquo;s bow. The delicate side-fins, and
      the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
      appearance of a baby&amp;rsquo;s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Line! line!&amp;rdquo; cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; &amp;ldquo;him fast! him
      fast!&amp;mdash;Who line him! Who struck?&amp;mdash;Two whale; one big, one
      little!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What ails ye, man?&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look-e here,&amp;rdquo; said Queequeg, pointing down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
      fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
      the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
      air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame
      Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not
      seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the
      maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub
      is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed
      divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in
      the deep.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
      most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation
      which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
      time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and
      Jacob:&amp;mdash;a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
      curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
      themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts
      in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter&amp;rsquo;s lance, the mother&amp;rsquo;s pouring
      milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very
      sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with
      strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute &lt;i&gt;more
      hominum&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
      affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
      fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in
      dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my
      being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and
      while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
      deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
      spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still
      engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly
      carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and
      some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged
      drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,
      was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when
      fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to
      hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic
      tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which
      is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we
      afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had
      broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon
      line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing
      among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
      battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire
      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening
      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the
      unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in
      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the
      cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that
      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his
      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that
      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently
      flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
      wounding and murdering his own comrades.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary
      fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a
      little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows
      from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the
      submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more
      contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in
      thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum
      was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when
      the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came
      tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one
      common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
      taking the stern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oars! Oars!&amp;rdquo; he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;gripe your
      oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
      you Queequeg&amp;mdash;the whale there!&amp;mdash;prick him!&amp;mdash;hit him! Stand
      up&amp;mdash;stand up, and stay so! Spring, men&amp;mdash;pull, men; never mind
      their backs&amp;mdash;scrape them!&amp;mdash;scrape away!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
      narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
      we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at
      the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar
      hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been
      one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently
      making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the
      loss of Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the
      fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy
      made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
      resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped
      together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight
      with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still
      lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped
      astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The
      waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;
      and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the
      floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also
      as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw
      near.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
      saying in the Fishery,&amp;mdash;the more whales the less fish. Of all the
      drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the
      time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft
      than the Pequod.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
      Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
      vast aggregations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have
      been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally
      observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are
      known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost
      entirely of females, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or
      bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
      male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
      his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
      ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
      over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
      endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
      concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
      leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
      than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
      comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
      yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
      whole they are hereditarily entitled to &lt;i&gt;en bon point&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
      ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
      search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower
      of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from
      spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
      unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down
      the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in
      anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive
      temperature of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
      interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming
      that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies, with
      what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High
      times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to
      invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the Bashaw will, he
      cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed; for, alas! all
      fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible
      duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes
      come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower
      jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
      like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured
      having the deep scars of these encounters,&amp;mdash;furrowed heads, broken
      teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated
      mouths.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the
      first rush of the harem&amp;rsquo;s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that
      lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there
      awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious
      Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other
      whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of
      these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength,
      and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters
      they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves; at
      least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous
      roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the
      nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he
      leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In
      good time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
      dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
      general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue
      supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent,
      repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and
      grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the
      meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young
      Leviathan from his amorous errors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the
      lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It
      is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that
      after going to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not
      what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would
      very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,
      but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of
      Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself
      what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his
      younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he
      inculcated into some of his pupils.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
      betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales.
      Almost universally, a lone whale&amp;mdash;as a solitary Leviathan is called&amp;mdash;proves
      an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no
      one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the
      wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so
      many moody secrets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
      mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those
      female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
      forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of
      all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
      excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and
      these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
      mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
      tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
      prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad
      at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when
      about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of
      settlements, that is, harems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still
      more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull&amp;mdash;poor
      devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school,
      and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes
      lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
      necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
      fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a
      whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and
      captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor
      contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,&amp;mdash;after
      a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose
      from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to
      leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it
      alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and
      violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not
      some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
      cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,
      was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695.
      But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the
      American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this
      matter. They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness
      surpasses Justinian&amp;rsquo;s Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for
      the Suppression of Meddling with other People&amp;rsquo;s Business. Yes; these laws
      might be engraven on a Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon,
      and worn round the neck, so small are they.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
      brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound
      it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when
      it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
      controllable by the occupant or occupants,&amp;mdash;a mast, an oar, a
      nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
      same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
      other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
      plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as
      their intention so to do.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
      themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks&amp;mdash;the
      Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
      honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
      it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
      possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
      others are by no means so scrupulous.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in
      England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a
      whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
      succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
      their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
      itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with
      the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the
      very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated
      with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; teeth, and
      assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now
      retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the
      whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for
      the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
      judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
      illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein
      a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife&amp;rsquo;s viciousness, had at
      last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years,
      repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of
      her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,
      that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once
      had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging
      viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that
      she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman
      re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman&amp;rsquo;s
      property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in
      her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale
      and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
      learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,&amp;mdash;That as for the boat, he
      awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save
      their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and
      line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a
      Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line
      because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a
      property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish
      had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo,
      the aforesaid articles were theirs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
      possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter,
      the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously
      quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited
      case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on
      reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for
      notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the
      Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Is it not a saying in every one&amp;rsquo;s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
      that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
      possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
      Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is
      the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow&amp;rsquo;s last
      mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain&amp;rsquo;s marble mansion
      with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the
      ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the
      bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone&amp;rsquo;s family from starvation; what is
      that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of
      Savesoul&amp;rsquo;s income of Â£100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
      hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
      without any of Savesoul&amp;rsquo;s help) what is that globular Â£100,000 but a
      Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder&amp;rsquo;s hereditary towns and hamlets but
      Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland,
      but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas
      but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not Possession the whole of
      the law?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
      kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
      internationally and universally applicable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
      Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?
      What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to
      England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish?
      What all men&amp;rsquo;s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of
      religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious
      smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is
      the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a
      Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?

      CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
    &lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
      context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
      that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
      and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
      in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate
      remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force
      in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
      touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in
      a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the
      English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially
      reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious
      proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I
      proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two
      years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of
      the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching
      a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.
      Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a
      sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office
      directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to
      the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this
      office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily
      employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by
      virtue of that same fobbing of them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
      trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
      fish high and dry, promising themselves a good Â£150 from the precious oil
      and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale
      with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps
      a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of
      Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale&amp;rsquo;s head, he says&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Hands
      off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord
      Warden&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo; Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation&amp;mdash;so
      truly English&amp;mdash;knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching
      their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
      stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
      hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length
      one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to
      speak,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The Duke.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is his.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
      that to go to the Duke&amp;rsquo;s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains
      but our blisters?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is his.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
      getting a livelihood?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is his.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this
      whale.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is his.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It is his.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
      Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
      lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
      deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of
      the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take
      the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which
      my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published) that he
      had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the
      reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would
      decline meddling with other people&amp;rsquo;s business. Is this the still militant
      old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands
      coercing alms of beggars?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to
      the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire
      then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that
      right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the
      reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and
      Queen, &amp;ldquo;because of its superior excellence.&amp;rdquo; And by the soundest
      commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
      for that, ye lawyers!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In his treatise on &amp;ldquo;Queen-Gold,&amp;rdquo; or Queen-pinmoney, an old King&amp;rsquo;s Bench
      author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: &amp;ldquo;Ye tail is ye Queen&amp;rsquo;s, that
      ye Queen&amp;rsquo;s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.&amp;rdquo; Now this was
      written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right
      whale was largely used in ladies&amp;rsquo; bodices. But this same bone is not in
      the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
      like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An
      allegorical meaning may lurk here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers&amp;mdash;the
      whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
      nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown&amp;rsquo;s ordinary revenue. I
      know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference
      it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the
      whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to
      that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously
      grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in
      all things, even in law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
      insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.&amp;rdquo; &lt;i&gt;Sir T. Browne, V.E.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
      were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many
      noses on the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three
      pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in
      the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I will bet something now,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, &amp;ldquo;that somewhere hereabouts are
      some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
      would keel up before long.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
      lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
      alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
      his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and
      hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
      must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has
      died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It
      may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;
      worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent
      to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that
      no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there
      those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained
      from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the
      nature of attar-of-rose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
      had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a
      nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
      problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious
      dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely
      bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall
      see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale
      as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
      recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted
      round the tail of one of these whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fellow, now,&amp;rdquo; he banteringly laughed, standing in the
      ship&amp;rsquo;s bows, &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of
      Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their
      boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and
      sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow
      candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get
      won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to dip the Captain&amp;rsquo;s wick into; aye, we all know these
      things; but look ye, here&amp;rsquo;s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
      the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the
      dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,
      pass round a hat, some one, and let&amp;rsquo;s make him a present of a little oil
      for dear charity&amp;rsquo;s sake. For what oil he&amp;rsquo;ll get from that drugged whale
      there, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And
      as for the other whale, why, I&amp;rsquo;ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and
      trying out these three masts of ours, than he&amp;rsquo;ll get from that bundle of
      bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a
      good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has
      thought of that. It&amp;rsquo;s worth trying. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m for it;&amp;rdquo; and so saying he
      started for the quarter-deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or
      no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
      escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
      now called his boat&amp;rsquo;s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
      across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French
      taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
      huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes
      projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical
      folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt
      letters, he read &amp;ldquo;Bouton de Rose,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and
      this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Though Stubb did not understand the &lt;i&gt;Bouton&lt;/i&gt; part of the inscription, yet
      the word &lt;i&gt;rose&lt;/i&gt;, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently
      explained the whole to him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A wooden rose-bud, eh?&amp;rdquo; he cried with his hand to his nose, &amp;ldquo;that will do
      very well; but how like all creation it smells!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had
      to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the
      blasted whale; and so talk over it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Bouton-de-Rose,
      ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the
      chief-mate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;What&lt;/i&gt; whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; Whale&amp;mdash;a Sperm Whale&amp;mdash;Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale&amp;mdash;no.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Very good, then; good bye now, and I&amp;rsquo;ll call again in a minute.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over
      the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a
      trumpet and shouted&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;No, Sir! No!&amp;rdquo; Upon which Ahab retired, and
      Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
      and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter with your nose, there?&amp;rdquo; said Stubb. &amp;ldquo;Broke it?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I wish it was broken, or that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any nose at all!&amp;rdquo; answered
      the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.
      &amp;ldquo;But what are you holding &lt;i&gt;yours&lt;/i&gt; for?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, nothing! It&amp;rsquo;s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain&amp;rsquo;t it?
      Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
      Bouton-de-Rose?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What in the devil&amp;rsquo;s name do you want here?&amp;rdquo; roared the Guernseyman,
      flying into a sudden passion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! keep cool&amp;mdash;cool? yes, that&amp;rsquo;s the word! why don&amp;rsquo;t you pack those
      whales in ice while you&amp;rsquo;re working at &amp;rsquo;em? But joking aside, though; do
      you know, Rose-bud, that it&amp;rsquo;s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
      such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn&amp;rsquo;t a gill in his
      whole carcase.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I know that well enough; but, d&amp;rsquo;ye see, the Captain here won&amp;rsquo;t believe
      it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
      come aboard, and mayhap he&amp;rsquo;ll believe you, if he won&amp;rsquo;t me; and so I&amp;rsquo;ll get
      out of this dirty scrape.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,&amp;rdquo; rejoined Stubb, and
      with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
      itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
      heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and
      talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses
      upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then
      pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get
      some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in
      coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken
      the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
      puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the
      Captain&amp;rsquo;s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery
      face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This
      was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the
      proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain&amp;rsquo;s round-house
      (&lt;i&gt;cabinet&lt;/i&gt; he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help
      yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
      Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
      expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had
      brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him
      carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the
      slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace
      on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so
      that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and
      satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their
      sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,
      under cover of an interpreter&amp;rsquo;s office, was to tell the Captain what he
      pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any
      nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small
      and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large
      whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with
      watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
      introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
      aspect of interpreting between them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What shall I say to him first?&amp;rdquo; said he.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, &amp;ldquo;you
      may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
      though I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be a judge.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He says, Monsieur,&amp;rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
      captain, &amp;ldquo;that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and
      chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
      blasted whale they had brought alongside.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What now?&amp;rdquo; said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
      carefully, I&amp;rsquo;m quite certain that he&amp;rsquo;s no more fit to command a whale-ship
      than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he&amp;rsquo;s a baboon.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
      far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,
      as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew
      to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the
      cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What now?&amp;rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that&amp;mdash;that&amp;mdash;in
      fact, tell him I&amp;rsquo;ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
      else.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that he&amp;rsquo;s very happy to have been of any service to
      us.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
      (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his
      cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,&amp;rdquo; said the interpreter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thank him heartily; but tell him it&amp;rsquo;s against my principles to drink with
      the man I&amp;rsquo;ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that his principles won&amp;rsquo;t admit of his drinking; but
      that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
      best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
      it&amp;rsquo;s so calm they won&amp;rsquo;t drift.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
      the Guernsey-man to this effect,&amp;mdash;that having a long tow-line in his
      boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
      whale of the two from the ship&amp;rsquo;s side. While the Frenchman&amp;rsquo;s boats, then,
      were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at
      his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long
      tow-line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
      hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
      Pequod slid in between him and Stubb&amp;rsquo;s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
      pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his
      intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
      cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the
      body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
      digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
      against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery
      buried in fat English loam. His boat&amp;rsquo;s crew were all in high excitement,
      eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,
      and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look
      disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly
      from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of
      perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being
      absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another,
      without at all blending with it for a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I have it, I have it,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
      the subterranean regions, &amp;ldquo;a purse! a purse!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
      something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese;
      very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb;
      it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is
      ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls
      were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more,
      perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab&amp;rsquo;s loud
      command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid
      them good bye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin
      was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.
      For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise
      origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.
      Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet
      the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on
      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris
      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,
      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,
      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,
      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it
      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s
      in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
      themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale!
      Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by
      others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a
      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat
      loads of Brandreth&amp;rsquo;s pills, and then running out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way, as
      laborers do in blasting rocks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
      hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors&amp;rsquo; 
      trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more
      than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found
      in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying
      of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we
      are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that
      saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also
      forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,
      Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,
      owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and
      which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered
      as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman&amp;rsquo;s two
      whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been
      disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy
      business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales
      always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in
      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it
      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and
      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any
      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and
      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is
      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city
      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,
      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place
      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being
      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,
      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation
      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite
      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years
      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,
      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that
      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or
      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of
      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor
      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a
      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;
      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,
      that the motion of a Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,
      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then
      shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?
      Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent
      with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander
      the Great?
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
      significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s crew; an
      event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly
      merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy
      of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
      few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
      the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
      these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats&amp;rsquo; 
      crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
      wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was
      so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by
      abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his
      tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
      white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
      one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
      torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
      very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his
      tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,
      freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year&amp;rsquo;s calendar should
      show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New
      Year&amp;rsquo;s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
      brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous
      ebony, panelled in king&amp;rsquo;s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life&amp;rsquo;s
      peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had
      somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
      brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
      subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange
      wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural
      lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once
      enlivened many a fiddler&amp;rsquo;s frolic on the green; and at melodious
      even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one
      star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended
      against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful
      glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its
      most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then
      lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out
      those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,
      once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
      stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb&amp;rsquo;s after-oarsman
      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,
      temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but
      happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
      therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
      him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to
      the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
      fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,
      in this instance, to be right under poor Pip&amp;rsquo;s seat. The involuntary
      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the
      boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against
      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in
      it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale
      started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor
      Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged
      there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and
      neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated
      Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended
      its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed
      interrogatively, &amp;ldquo;Cut?&amp;rdquo; Meantime Pip&amp;rsquo;s blue, choked face plainly looked,
      Do, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,
      this entire thing happened.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Damn him, cut!&amp;rdquo; roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
      saved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
      yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular
      cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still
      half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially
      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,
      Pip, except&amp;mdash;but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice
      ever is. Now, in general, &lt;i&gt;Stick to the boat&lt;/i&gt;, is your true motto in
      whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when &lt;i&gt;Leap from the boat&lt;/i&gt;, is still
      better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give
      undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
      margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and
      concluded with a peremptory command, &amp;ldquo;Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the
      Lord, I won&amp;rsquo;t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose
      whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you
      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&amp;rsquo;t jump any more.&amp;rdquo;
       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,
      yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes
      with his benevolence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
      under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time
      he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,
      Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller&amp;rsquo;s trunk. Alas!
      Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue
      day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all
      round, to the horizon, like gold-beater&amp;rsquo;s skin hammered out to the
      extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip&amp;rsquo;s ebon head showed like a
      head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.
      Stubb&amp;rsquo;s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In
      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.
      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black
      head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the
      brightest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
      lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
      middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
      when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea&amp;mdash;mark how closely
      they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
      did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and
      he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
      quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
      oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested
      by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
      unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called,
      is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies
      and armies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying
      whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb&amp;rsquo;s boat
      was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that
      Pip&amp;rsquo;s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest
      chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little
      negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The
      sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his
      soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous
      depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and
      fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
      hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
      Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the
      firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God&amp;rsquo;s foot upon the
      treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him
      mad. So man&amp;rsquo;s insanity is heaven&amp;rsquo;s sense; and wandering from all mortal
      reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent
      as his God.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
      fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
      like abandonment befell myself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That whale of Stubb&amp;rsquo;s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
      Pequod&amp;rsquo;s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously
      detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the
      Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
      dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when
      the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere
      going to the try-works, of which anon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several
      others, I sat down before a large Constantine&amp;rsquo;s bath of it, I found it
      strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid
      part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet
      and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a
      favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener!
      such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for only a few
      minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine
      and spiralise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
      exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
      indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among
      those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within
      the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their
      opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
      uncontaminated aroma,&amp;mdash;literally and truly, like the smell of spring
      violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow;
      I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I
      washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old
      Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat
      of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all
      ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
      till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange
      sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my
      co-laborers&amp;rsquo; hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.
      Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this
      avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and
      looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,&amp;mdash;Oh! my
      dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or
      know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all
      round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze
      ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
      many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases
      man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable
      felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in
      the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the
      country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case
      eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of
      angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin
      to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
      part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is
      tough with congealed tendons&amp;mdash;a wad of muscle&amp;mdash;but still
      contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is
      first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much
      like blocks of Berkshire marble.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
      whale&amp;rsquo;s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
      often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a
      most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
      imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
      snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
      purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it
      is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole
      behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a
      royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing
      him to have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that
      particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of
      the vineyards of Champagne.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the
      course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
      adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original
      with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance. It is an
      ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of
      sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to
      be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
      sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
      dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland
      or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls
      who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary.
      But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman&amp;rsquo;s nipper is a short
      firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan&amp;rsquo;s
      tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the
      size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it
      operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of
      magic, allures along with it all impurities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
      to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
      This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
      blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper
      time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
      terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull
      lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in
      pairs,&amp;mdash;a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is
      similar to a frigate&amp;rsquo;s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is
      something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet
      of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and
      lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,
      perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is
      sharp as hone can make it; the spademan&amp;rsquo;s feet are shoeless; the thing he
      stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.
      If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants&amp;rsquo;, would you
      be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
      post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
      windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
      curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
      there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
      cistern in the whale&amp;rsquo;s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
      jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
      surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,&amp;mdash;longer
      than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
      jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is;
      or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in
      the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,
      King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it
      for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th
      chapter of the First Book of Kings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted
      by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,
      and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
      carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle
      deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African
      hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a
      pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its
      diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere
      long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the
      pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other
      end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands
      before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to
      all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while
      employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots;
      an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise
      against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the
      minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator&amp;rsquo;s desk. Arrayed
      in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves;
      what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this
      mincer!*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to
      the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin
      slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out
      the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased,
      besides perhaps improving it in quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished
      by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
      masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It
      is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
      roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
      fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar,
      some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not
      penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by
      ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to
      the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely
      covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we
      expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels&amp;rsquo; 
      capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they
      are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
      punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl
      into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in
      polishing them&amp;mdash;one man in each pot, side by side&amp;mdash;many
      confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a
      place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand
      try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,
      that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in
      geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example,
      will descend from any point in precisely the same time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry
      of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the
      furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy
      doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented from
      communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
      extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
      inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
      fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
      from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was about nine o&amp;rsquo;clock at night that the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s try-works were first
      started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the
      business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
      works.&amp;rdquo; This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his
      shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in
      a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time
      with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition
      to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,
      shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
      considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.
      Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once
      ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would
      that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and
      inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the
      time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk
      in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day
      of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
      darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
      flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
      illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.
      The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some
      vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold
      Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets
      of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them
      in conflagrations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
      in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan
      harpooneers, always the whale-ship&amp;rsquo;s stokers. With huge pronged poles they
      pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up
      the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors
      to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every
      pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all
      eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on
      the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served
      for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
      looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in
      their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat,
      their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their
      teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of
      the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their
      tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter
      forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and
      fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge
      pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and
      the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all
      sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with
      fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness,
      seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander&amp;rsquo;s soul.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,
      in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the
      ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me,
      capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred
      visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
      drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
      thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly
      conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side,
      which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just
      beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half
      conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching
      them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass
      before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been
      watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing
      seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of
      redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing
      I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
      havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.
      Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that
      the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is
      the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself
      about, and was fronting the ship&amp;rsquo;s stern, with my back to her prow and the
      compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel
      from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad
      and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the
      night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
      hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint
      of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness
      makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies
      will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the
      morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,
      golden, glad sun, the only true lamp&amp;mdash;all others but liars!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome&amp;rsquo;s
      accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
      deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which
      is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So,
      therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that
      mortal man cannot be true&amp;mdash;not true, or undeveloped. With books the
      same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all
      books is Solomon&amp;rsquo;s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.
      &amp;ldquo;All is vanity.&amp;rdquo; ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian
      Solomon&amp;rsquo;s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks
      fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls
      Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and
      throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and
      therefore jolly;&amp;mdash;not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones,
      and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But even Solomon, he says, &amp;ldquo;the man that wandereth out of the way of
      understanding shall remain&amp;rdquo; (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, even while living) &amp;ldquo;in the congregation
      of the dead.&amp;rdquo; Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee,
      deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but
      there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some
      souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of
      them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for
      ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even
      in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds
      upon the plain, even though they soar.

      CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Had you descended from the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s try-works to the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s forecastle,
      where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would
      have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of
      canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken
      vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon
      his hooded eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens.
      To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his
      pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of
      light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin&amp;rsquo;s lamp, and
      lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship&amp;rsquo;s black hull
      still houses an illumination.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps&amp;mdash;often
      but old bottles and vials, though&amp;mdash;to the copper cooler at the
      try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns,
      too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated
      state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It
      is sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so
      as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on
      the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.

      CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried
      from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and
      slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and
      beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to
      the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded surtout
      becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned
      to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti,
      oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;&amp;mdash;but now it remains to
      conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing&amp;mdash;singing,
      if I may&amp;mdash;the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the
      casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan
      returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
      before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel
      casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and
      that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed
      over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery
      deck, like so many land slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in
      their course; and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can
      play upon them, for now, &lt;i&gt;ex officio&lt;/i&gt;, every sailor is a cooper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
      hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down
      go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are
      replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents
      in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of
      blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale&amp;rsquo;s
      head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery
      yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the
      mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great
      leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
      self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you
      would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most
      scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a
      singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look
      so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the
      ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and
      whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to
      the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the
      bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full
      tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous
      implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put
      away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works,
      completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are
      coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry
      of almost the entire ship&amp;rsquo;s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
      is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
      ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
      immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out
      the daintiest Holland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
      humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
      propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to
      taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such
      musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of
      audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring
      us napkins!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on
      spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the
      old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere.
      Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors,
      which know no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours;
      when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day
      rowing on the Line,&amp;mdash;they only step to the deck to carry vast chains,
      and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very
      sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the
      equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all
      this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make
      a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just
      buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of
      &amp;ldquo;There she blows!&amp;rdquo; and away they fly to fight another whale, and go
      through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is
      man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings
      extracted from this world&amp;rsquo;s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and
      then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and
      learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this
      done, when&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;There she blows!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;the ghost is spouted up, and away
      we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life&amp;rsquo;s old routine
      again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
      thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee
      along the Peruvian coast last voyage&amp;mdash;and, foolish as I am, taught
      thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
      taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
      the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added
      how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was
      wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the
      particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his
      glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot
      like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when
      resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same
      riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore
      the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild
      longing, if not hopefulness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
      attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though
      now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some
      monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain
      significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and
      the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the
      cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the
      Milky Way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
      heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
      head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the
      rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
      untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito
      glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by
      ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
      darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
      sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set
      apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their
      sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale&amp;rsquo;s
      talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,
      wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to
      spend it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and
      tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun&amp;rsquo;s disks and
      stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in
      luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to
      derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through
      those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
      of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL
      ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
      middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
      and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows
      no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes&amp;rsquo; 
      summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing
      cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the
      signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun
      entering the equinoctial point at Libra.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
      pausing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all
      other grand and lofty things; look here,&amp;mdash;three peaks as proud as
      Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
      courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
      are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
      which, like a magician&amp;rsquo;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors
      back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask
      the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined
      sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the
      equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at
      Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, &amp;rsquo;tis fit that
      man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here&amp;rsquo;s stout
      stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil&amp;rsquo;s claws must have
      left their mouldings there since yesterday,&amp;rdquo; murmured Starbuck to himself,
      leaning against the bulwarks. &amp;ldquo;The old man seems to read Belshazzar&amp;rsquo;s
      awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below;
      let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks,
      that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this
      vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of
      Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes,
      the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun
      meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture;
      and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we
      gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
      sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There now&amp;rsquo;s the old Mogul,&amp;rdquo; soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s
      been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
      faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And
      all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill
      or in Corlaer&amp;rsquo;s Hook, I&amp;rsquo;d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph!
      in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen
      doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your
      doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia,
      your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and
      joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this
      doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me
      read it once. Halloa! here&amp;rsquo;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what
      old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below
      calls ditto. I&amp;rsquo;ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised
      with Daboll&amp;rsquo;s arithmetic, I&amp;rsquo;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of
      these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&amp;rsquo;s the
      book. Let&amp;rsquo;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&amp;rsquo;s always among
      &amp;rsquo;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are&amp;mdash;here they go&amp;mdash;all alive:&amp;mdash;Aries,
      or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here&amp;rsquo;s Gemini himself, or the
      Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among &amp;rsquo;em. Aye, here on the coin he&amp;rsquo;s just
      crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.
      Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You&amp;rsquo;ll
      do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
      thoughts. That&amp;rsquo;s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
      calendar, and Bowditch&amp;rsquo;s navigator, and Daboll&amp;rsquo;s arithmetic go. Signs and
      wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant
      in wonders! There&amp;rsquo;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist&amp;mdash;hark! By
      Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man
      in one round chapter; and now I&amp;rsquo;ll read it off, straight out of the book.
      Come, Almanack! To begin: there&amp;rsquo;s Aries, or the Ram&amp;mdash;lecherous dog,
      he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull&amp;mdash;he bumps us the first thing;
      then Gemini, or the Twins&amp;mdash;that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach
      Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going
      from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path&amp;mdash;he gives a few
      fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the
      Virgin! that&amp;rsquo;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,
      when pop comes Libra, or the Scales&amp;mdash;happiness weighed and found
      wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump,
      as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the
      wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,
      is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&amp;rsquo;s the
      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and
      headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his
      whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we
      sleep. There&amp;rsquo;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through
      it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he,
      aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does
      jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&amp;rsquo;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here
      comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&amp;rsquo;s hear
      what he&amp;rsquo;ll have to say. There; he&amp;rsquo;s before it; he&amp;rsquo;ll out with something
      presently. So, so; he&amp;rsquo;s beginning.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a
      certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what&amp;rsquo;s all this
      staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that&amp;rsquo;s true; and at two
      cents the cigar, that&amp;rsquo;s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won&amp;rsquo;t smoke dirty
      pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here&amp;rsquo;s nine hundred and sixty of
      them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy &amp;rsquo;em out.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
      foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
      wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman&amp;mdash;the old
      hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
      luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of
      the mast; why, there&amp;rsquo;s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he&amp;rsquo;s back
      again; what does that mean? Hark! he&amp;rsquo;s muttering&amp;mdash;voice like an old
      worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the
      sun stands in some one of these signs. I&amp;rsquo;ve studied signs, and know their
      marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in
      Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign;
      for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what&amp;rsquo;s the horse-shoe sign?
      The lion is the horse-shoe sign&amp;mdash;the roaring and devouring lion.
      Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
      one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg&amp;mdash;all
      tattooing&amp;mdash;looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
      Cannibal? As I live he&amp;rsquo;s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
      thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
      suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon&amp;rsquo;s Astronomy in the back country.
      And by Jove, he&amp;rsquo;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh&amp;mdash;I
      guess it&amp;rsquo;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of
      the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king&amp;rsquo;s trowsers. But,
      aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of
      sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say,
      with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself;
      there is a sun on the coin&amp;mdash;fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more
      and more. This way comes Pip&amp;mdash;poor boy! would he had died, or I; he&amp;rsquo;s
      half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters&amp;mdash;myself
      included&amp;mdash;and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
      face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Upon my soul, he&amp;rsquo;s been studying Murray&amp;rsquo;s Grammar! Improving his mind,
      poor fellow! But what&amp;rsquo;s that he says now&amp;mdash;hist!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, he&amp;rsquo;s getting it by heart&amp;mdash;hist! again.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s funny.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I&amp;rsquo;m a crow,
      especially when I stand a&amp;rsquo;top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw!
      caw! caw! Ain&amp;rsquo;t I a crow? And where&amp;rsquo;s the scare-crow? There he stands; two
      bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the
      sleeves of an old jacket.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Wonder if he means me?&amp;mdash;complimentary!&amp;mdash;poor lad!&amp;mdash;I could
      go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I&amp;rsquo;ll quit Pip&amp;rsquo;s vicinity. I can
      stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he&amp;rsquo;s too crazy-witty for my
      sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s the ship&amp;rsquo;s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to
      unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what&amp;rsquo;s the consequence? Then
      again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught&amp;rsquo;s nailed to the
      mast it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White
      Whale; he&amp;rsquo;ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland
      county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in
      it; some old darkey&amp;rsquo;s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they&amp;rsquo;ll
      say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find
      a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the
      gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser&amp;rsquo;ll hoard ye soon!
      Hish! hish! God goes &amp;rsquo;mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and
      cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your
      hoe-cake done!&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
      down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
      hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
      captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat&amp;rsquo;s bow. He was a
      darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
      thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
      festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
      behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar&amp;rsquo;s surcoat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;See you this?&amp;rdquo; and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he
      held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like
      a mallet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Man my boat!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
      him&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Stand by to lower!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew
      were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But
      here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
      moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
      once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
      always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
      the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel
      at a moment&amp;rsquo;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody&amp;mdash;except
      those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen&amp;mdash;to clamber up
      a ship&amp;rsquo;s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift
      the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it
      half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship
      of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now
      found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly
      eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in
      the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two
      officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular
      ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of
      tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink
      them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea
      bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange
      captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, &amp;ldquo;I see, I
      see!&amp;mdash;avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the
      cutting-tackle.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
      previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
      blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was
      quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
      solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the
      fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
      word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own
      weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the
      tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently
      landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in
      welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg,
      and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his
      walrus way, &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!&amp;mdash;an arm
      and a leg!&amp;mdash;an arm that never can shrink, d&amp;rsquo;ye see; and a leg that
      never can run. Where did&amp;rsquo;st thou see the White Whale?&amp;mdash;how long ago?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The White Whale,&amp;rdquo; said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the
      East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope;
      &amp;ldquo;there I saw him, on the Line, last season.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And he took that arm off, did he?&amp;rdquo; asked Ahab, now sliding down from the
      capstan, and resting on the Englishman&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, as he did so.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Spin me the yarn,&amp;rdquo; said Ahab; &amp;ldquo;how was it?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,&amp;rdquo; began
      the Englishman. &amp;ldquo;I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one
      day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to
      one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and
      milling round so, that my boat&amp;rsquo;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all
      their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom
      of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all
      crows&amp;rsquo; feet and wrinkles.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was he, it was he!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
      breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye&amp;mdash;they were mine&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; irons,&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, exultingly&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;but
      on!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Give me a chance, then,&amp;rdquo; said the Englishman, good-humoredly. &amp;ldquo;Well, this
      old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into
      the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, I see!&amp;mdash;wanted to part it; free the fast-fish&amp;mdash;an old
      trick&amp;mdash;I know him.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;How it was exactly,&amp;rdquo; continued the one-armed commander, &amp;ldquo;I do not know;
      but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;
      but we didn&amp;rsquo;t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line,
      bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale&amp;rsquo;s; that
      went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a
      noble great whale it was&amp;mdash;the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in
      my life&amp;mdash;I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he
      seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the
      tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat&amp;rsquo;s crew
      for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my
      first mate&amp;rsquo;s boat&amp;mdash;Mr. Mounttop&amp;rsquo;s here (by the way, Captain&amp;mdash;Mounttop;
      Mounttop&amp;mdash;the captain);&amp;mdash;as I was saying, I jumped into
      Mounttop&amp;rsquo;s boat, which, d&amp;rsquo;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then;
      and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
      But, Lord, look you, sir&amp;mdash;hearts and souls alive, man&amp;mdash;the next
      instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat&amp;mdash;both eyes out&amp;mdash;all
      befogged and bedeadened with black foam&amp;mdash;the whale&amp;rsquo;s tail looming
      straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No
      use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
      sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to
      toss it overboard&amp;mdash;down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my
      boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white
      hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck
      out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole
      sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a
      combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one
      good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed
      second iron towing along near me caught me here&amp;rdquo; (clapping his hand just
      below his shoulder); &amp;ldquo;yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
      Hell&amp;rsquo;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good
      God, the barb ript its way along the flesh&amp;mdash;clear along the whole
      length of my arm&amp;mdash;came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;&amp;mdash;and
      that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain&amp;mdash;Dr.
      Bunger, ship&amp;rsquo;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,&amp;mdash;the captain). Now, Bunger
      boy, spin your part of the yarn.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
      time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
      gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
      one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
      trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
      marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
      occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
      crippled captains. But, at his superior&amp;rsquo;s introduction of him to Ahab, he
      politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain&amp;rsquo;s bidding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It was a shocking bad wound,&amp;rdquo; began the whale-surgeon; &amp;ldquo;and, taking my
      advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,&amp;rdquo; interrupted the one-armed
      captain, addressing Ahab; &amp;ldquo;go on, boy.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
      weather there on the Line. But it was no use&amp;mdash;I did all I could; sat
      up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, very severe!&amp;rdquo; chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering
      his voice, &amp;ldquo;Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn&amp;rsquo;t
      see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about
      three o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and
      was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically
      severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don&amp;rsquo;t ye? You know
      you&amp;rsquo;re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be
      killed by you than kept alive by any other man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;said
      the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;is
      apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort.
      But I may as well say&amp;mdash;en passant, as the French remark&amp;mdash;that I
      myself&amp;mdash;that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy&amp;mdash;am
      a strict total abstinence man; I never drink&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Water!&amp;rdquo; cried the captain; &amp;ldquo;he never drinks it; it&amp;rsquo;s a sort of fits to
      him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on&amp;mdash;go on
      with the arm story.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes, I may as well,&amp;rdquo; said the surgeon, coolly. &amp;ldquo;I was about observing,
      sir, before Captain Boomer&amp;rsquo;s facetious interruption, that spite of my best
      and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth
      was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two
      feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short,
      it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no
      hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;pointing
      at it with the marlingspike&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;that is the captain&amp;rsquo;s work, not mine;
      he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to
      the end, to knock some one&amp;rsquo;s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
      once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,
      sir&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a
      bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry
      trace, or any token of ever having been a wound&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Well, the captain
      there will tell you how that came here; he knows.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said the captain, &amp;ldquo;but his mother did; he was born with it.
      Oh, you solemn rogue, you&amp;mdash;you Bunger! was there ever such another
      Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
      pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What became of the White Whale?&amp;rdquo; now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
      impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh!&amp;rdquo; cried the one-armed captain, &amp;ldquo;oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
      didn&amp;rsquo;t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
      then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some
      time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick&amp;mdash;as
      some call him&amp;mdash;and then I knew it was he.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Did&amp;rsquo;st thou cross his wake again?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Twice.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But could not fasten?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try to: ain&amp;rsquo;t one limb enough? What should I do without
      this other arm? And I&amp;rsquo;m thinking Moby Dick doesn&amp;rsquo;t bite so much as he
      swallows.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, then,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Bunger, &amp;ldquo;give him your left arm for bait to get
      the right. Do you know, gentlemen&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;very gravely and mathematically
      bowing to each Captain in succession&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Do you know, gentlemen, that
      the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
      Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even
      a man&amp;rsquo;s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White
      Whale&amp;rsquo;s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a
      single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like
      the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making
      believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in
      good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave
      him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&amp;rsquo;ye see. No possible
      way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his
      general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about
      it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of
      giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only
      let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that&amp;rsquo;s all.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, thank ye, Bunger,&amp;rdquo; said the English Captain, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s welcome to the arm
      he has, since I can&amp;rsquo;t help it, and didn&amp;rsquo;t know him then; but not to
      another one. No more White Whales for me; I&amp;rsquo;ve lowered for him once, and
      that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know
      that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
      he&amp;rsquo;s best let alone; don&amp;rsquo;t you think so, Captain?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;glancing at the
      ivory leg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone,
      that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He&amp;rsquo;s all a magnet!
      How long since thou saw&amp;rsquo;st him last? Which way heading?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;rdquo; cried Bunger, stoopingly
      walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; &amp;ldquo;this man&amp;rsquo;s blood&amp;mdash;bring
      the thermometer!&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s at the boiling point!&amp;mdash;his pulse makes
      these planks beat!&amp;mdash;sir!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;taking a lancet from his pocket, and
      drawing near to Ahab&amp;rsquo;s arm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast!&amp;rdquo; roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Man the
      boat! Which way heading?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good God!&amp;rdquo; cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter? He was heading east, I think.&amp;mdash;Is your Captain
      crazy?&amp;rdquo; whispering Fedallah.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take
      the boat&amp;rsquo;s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards
      him, commanded the ship&amp;rsquo;s sailors to stand by to lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In a moment he was standing in the boat&amp;rsquo;s stern, and the Manilla men were
      springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back
      to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood
      upright till alongside of the Pequod.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant
      of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp;amp;
      Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman&amp;rsquo;s opinion, comes not far behind
      the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real
      historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this
      great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not
      make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships
      that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years
      previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and
      the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the
      North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,
      that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with
      civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they
      were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and
      at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and
      was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the
      great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to
      her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia&amp;rsquo;s example
      was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast
      Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with
      this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and
      all his Sons&amp;mdash;how many, their mother only knows&amp;mdash;and under their
      immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
      government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
      voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain,
      the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much
      does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a
      discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote
      waters of Japan. That ship&amp;mdash;well called the &amp;ldquo;Syren&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;made a
      noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling
      Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was
      commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
      the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have
      slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
      sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
      somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
      forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps&amp;mdash;every
      soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam
      I had&amp;mdash;long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
      ivory heel&amp;mdash;it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of
      that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I
      ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
      at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it&amp;rsquo;s
      squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands&amp;mdash;visitors and all&amp;mdash;were
      called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
      other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
      jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling
      gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go
      overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass
      the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle
      scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The beef was fine&amp;mdash;tough, but with body in it. They said it was
      bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
      certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
      symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you
      could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If
      you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you
      like billiard-balls. The bread&amp;mdash;but that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be helped; besides,
      it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only fresh
      fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy
      to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking
      her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook&amp;rsquo;s boilers,
      including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel
      Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;
      crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English
      whalers I know of&amp;mdash;not all though&amp;mdash;were such famous, hospitable
      ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
      joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
      will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter
      for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical
      whale research, when it has seemed needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
      Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in
      the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty
      to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship
      scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English,
      this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental
      and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is
      here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must
      be about whalers. The title was, &amp;ldquo;Dan Coopman,&amp;rdquo; wherefore I concluded that
      this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the
      fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in
      this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &amp;ldquo;Fitz
      Swackhammer.&amp;rdquo; But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of
      Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott&amp;rsquo;s, to
      whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles
      for his trouble&amp;mdash;this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the
      book, assured me that &amp;ldquo;Dan Coopman&amp;rdquo; did not mean &amp;ldquo;The Cooper,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;The
      Merchant.&amp;rdquo; In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of
      the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very
      interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was,
      headed, &amp;ldquo;Smeer,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Fat,&amp;rdquo; that I found a long detailed list of the
      outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from
      which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
      fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of
      butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp;amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
      (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
      beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the
      present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,
      barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
      beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
      incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
      application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own,
      touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low
      Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery.
      In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese
      consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous
      natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their
      vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid
      Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the
      convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
      polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
      climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
      including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much
      exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of
      180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have
      precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks&amp;rsquo; allowance,
      exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether
      these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have
      been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat&amp;rsquo;s head, and take
      good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they
      did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it
      remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the
      Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer
      sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might
      ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers
      have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising
      in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a
      good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the decanter.

      CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
      dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
      upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
      sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
      further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and
      casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones,
      set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional
      skeleton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,
      pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did
      erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy
      of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for
      exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on
      your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A
      veritable witness have you hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you
      seize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the
      joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings,
      making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
      dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath
      the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an
      opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small
      cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag,
      to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the
      lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and
      jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that
      young cub?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
      gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to
      my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For
      being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of
      Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the
      lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not
      very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
      with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together
      in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could
      invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells,
      inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed
      among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering
      waves had cast upon his shores.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
      unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
      head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed
      his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its
      fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the
      skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand
      temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrÃ¦ were carved with
      Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
      kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
      sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific
      lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so
      affrighted Damocles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the
      trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious
      earth beneath was as a weaver&amp;rsquo;s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it,
      whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living
      flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the
      shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these
      unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun
      seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver!
      unseen weaver!&amp;mdash;pause!&amp;mdash;one word!&amp;mdash;whither flows the
      fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?
      Speak, weaver!&amp;mdash;stay thy hand!&amp;mdash;but one single word with thee!
      Nay&amp;mdash;the shuttle flies&amp;mdash;the figures float from forth the loom;
      the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he
      weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice;
      and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only
      when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it.
      For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are
      inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard
      without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have
      villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all
      this din of the great world&amp;rsquo;s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be
      overheard afar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
      great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging&amp;mdash;a gigantic idler!
      Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
      him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
      with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself
      a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived
      with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
      skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet
      had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object
      of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear
      that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton&amp;mdash;brushed
      the vines aside&amp;mdash;broke through the ribs&amp;mdash;and with a ball of
      Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded
      colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I
      emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;
      naught was there but bones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.
      From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
      altitude of the final rib, &amp;ldquo;How now!&amp;rdquo; they shouted; &amp;ldquo;Dar&amp;rsquo;st thou measure
      this our god! That&amp;rsquo;s for us.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Aye, priests&amp;mdash;well, how long do ye
      make him, then?&amp;rdquo; But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
      feet and inches; they cracked each other&amp;rsquo;s sconces with their yard-sticks&amp;mdash;the
      great skull echoed&amp;mdash;and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly
      concluded my own admeasurements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
      recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
      measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer
      to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in
      Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have
      some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard
      that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the
      proprietors call &amp;ldquo;the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale
      in the United States.&amp;rdquo; Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton
      Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession
      the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the
      full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,
      were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King
      Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was
      lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford&amp;rsquo;s whale has been
      articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can
      open and shut him, in all his bony cavities&amp;mdash;spread out his ribs like
      a gigantic fan&amp;mdash;and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be
      put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show
      round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford
      thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the
      spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his
      cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
      verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
      wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
      such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the
      other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
      composing&amp;mdash;at least, what untattooed parts might remain&amp;mdash;I did
      not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
      enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale&amp;rsquo;s Skeleton.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
      statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
      are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
      upon Captain Scoresby&amp;rsquo;s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
      calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
      eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet
      in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety
      tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably
      outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one
      hundred inhabitants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
      leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman&amp;rsquo;s imagination?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,
      teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply
      point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed
      bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of
      the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated
      part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you
      must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed,
      otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we
      are about to view.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In length, the Sperm Whale&amp;rsquo;s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
      feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been
      ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in
      length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull
      and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain
      back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of
      its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his
      vitals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
      extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the
      hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of
      her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time,
      but a long, disconnected timber.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly
      six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively
      longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle
      ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the
      remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet
      and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly
      correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In
      some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath
      bridges over small streams.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the
      whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the
      Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
      which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the
      invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
      feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
      feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living
      magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked
      spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in
      flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here
      saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic,
      but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to
      comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
      attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the
      heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry
      flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
      be truly and livingly found out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane,
      to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it&amp;rsquo;s done,
      it looks much like Pompey&amp;rsquo;s Pillar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are forty and odd vertebrÃ¦ in all, which in the skeleton are not
      locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic
      spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one,
      is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four.
      The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two
      inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was
      told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost by some
      little cannibal urchins, the priest&amp;rsquo;s children, who had stolen them to
      play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of
      living things tapers off at last into simple child&amp;rsquo;s play.

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to
      enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
      compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
      folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the
      yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions
      of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers
      coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
      approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking
      the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the
      uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him in most of his
      present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify
      him in an archÃ¦ological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.
      Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan&amp;mdash;to an ant or a flea&amp;mdash;such
      portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when
      Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this
      emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said,
      that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
      dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson,
      expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer&amp;rsquo;s
      uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by
      a whale author like me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though
      it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this
      Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.
      Give me a condor&amp;rsquo;s quill! Give me Vesuvius&amp;rsquo; crater for an inkstand!
      Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this
      Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching
      comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the
      sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past,
      present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth,
      and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so
      magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its
      bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great
      and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
      who have tried it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials
      as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a
      stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,
      wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of
      preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier
      geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
      completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
      the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted
      links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
      posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto
      discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
      superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any
      known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them
      in general respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
      and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
      found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in
      Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among
      the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year
      1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening
      almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in
      excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s time. Cuvier
      pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown
      Leviathanic species.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
      complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on
      the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous
      slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.
      The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the
      name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the
      sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged
      reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant
      illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the
      skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully
      invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his
      paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in
      substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of
      the globe have blotted out of existence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws,
      ribs, and vertebrÃ¦, all characterized by partial resemblances to the
      existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other
      hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their
      incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous
      period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with
      man. Here Saturn&amp;rsquo;s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering
      glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed
      hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this
      world&amp;rsquo;s circumference, not an inhabitable hand&amp;rsquo;s breadth of land was
      visible. Then the whole world was the whale&amp;rsquo;s; and, king of creation, he
      left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who
      can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab&amp;rsquo;s harpoon had shed older blood
      than the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake
      hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
      existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
      before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
      stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
      ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
      for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print
      of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty
      years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and
      painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins,
      similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.
      Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in
      that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of
      the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the
      venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of
      which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
      oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that
      by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it
      without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either
      side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and
      wound the Whales when they light upon &amp;rsquo;em. They keep a Whale&amp;rsquo;s Rib of an
      incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its
      convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached
      by a Man upon a Camel&amp;rsquo;s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have
      layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that
      a Prophet who prophesy&amp;rsquo;d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do
      not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at
      the Base of the Temple.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
      Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale&amp;rsquo;s Magnitude Diminish?&amp;mdash;Will He Perish?
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the
      head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the
      long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original
      bulk of his sires.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
      present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found
      in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to
      man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to
      its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
      Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy
      feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the
      tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized
      modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen&amp;rsquo;s authority, that Sperm Whales
      have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
      advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it
      not be, that since Adam&amp;rsquo;s time they have degenerated?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
      gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells
      us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others
      which measured eight hundred feet in length&amp;mdash;Rope Walks and Thames
      Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke&amp;rsquo;s
      naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting
      down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one
      hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And
      LacÃ©pÃ¨de, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in
      the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one
      hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was
      published so late as A.D. 1825.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as
      big as his ancestors in Pliny&amp;rsquo;s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I,
      a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I
      cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were
      buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so
      much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the
      cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh
      tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as
      plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,
      not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s fat
      kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
      whale alone should have degenerated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
      recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
      at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through
      Behring&amp;rsquo;s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the
      world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental
      coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a
      chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be
      exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke
      his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
      which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
      of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
      their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
      where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a
      comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the
      hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period
      ago&amp;mdash;not a good lifetime&amp;mdash;the census of the buffalo in Illinois
      exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
      not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
      cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
      different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
      end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
      forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if
      at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the
      old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far
      west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the
      same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on
      horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
      thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
      statistically stated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual
      extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the
      latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods,
      were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the
      voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.
      Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some
      views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large
      degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other
      days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.
      That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the
      so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
      abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are
      only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer
      enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand
      has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
      firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
      impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss
      have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades
      of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their
      Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls
      there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of
      everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
      cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
      positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But
      though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000,
      have been annually slain on the nor&amp;rsquo; west coast by the Americans alone;
      yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little
      or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of
      the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto,
      the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of
      Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as
      droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to
      doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of
      years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive
      monarchs of the East&amp;mdash;if they still survive there in great numbers,
      much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture
      to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both
      Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
      combined.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
      whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore
      at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be
      contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by
      imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation
      yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were
      alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to the
      present human population of the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
      species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before
      the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries,
      and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah&amp;rsquo;s flood he despised Noah&amp;rsquo;s
      Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,
      to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and
      rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed
      defiance to the skies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 106. Ahab&amp;rsquo;s Leg.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his
      own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that
      his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after
      gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently
      wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever,
      something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already
      shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it
      still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem
      it entirely trustworthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
      been very long prior to the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s sailing from Nantucket, that he had
      been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some
      unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb
      having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and
      all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the
      agonizing wound was entirely cured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the
      anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
      former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
      reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
      songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable
      events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought
      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the
      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an
      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all
      hell&amp;rsquo;s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely
      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the
      deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest
      earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in
      them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some
      men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie
      the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the
      gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in
      the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why
      it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of
      the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like
      exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it
      were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg&amp;rsquo;s bruited reason
      for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching
      all Ahab&amp;rsquo;s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant
      darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this
      one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his
      temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
      dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a
      less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted
      casualty&amp;mdash;remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab&amp;mdash;invested
      itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and
      of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so
      far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;
      and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did
      it transpire upon the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s decks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or
      the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with
      earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
      practical procedures;&amp;mdash;he called the carpenter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
      set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
      with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus
      far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of
      the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the
      carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to
      provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the
      distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship&amp;rsquo;s forge was ordered to be
      hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the
      affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
      whatever iron contrivances might be needed.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
      abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
      from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
      seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
      But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the
      high, humane abstraction; the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s carpenter was no duplicate; hence,
      he now comes in person on this stage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to
      whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike
      experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the
      carpenter&amp;rsquo;s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those
      numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
      auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic
      remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in
      those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a
      large ship, upon a three or four years&amp;rsquo; voyage, in uncivilized and
      far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:&amp;mdash;repairing
      stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,
      inserting bull&amp;rsquo;s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,
      and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
      business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
      conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
      except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
      athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the
      carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files
      it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is
      made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and
      cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
      cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a
      soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the
      blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the
      carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy
      to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has
      the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his
      bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces
      under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden
      vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have
      him draw the tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and
      without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed
      but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now
      upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness
      of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon
      vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man
      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;
      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of
      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the
      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,
      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,
      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;&amp;mdash;yet
      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,
      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled
      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight
      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah&amp;rsquo;s ark. Was it that this old
      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,
      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever
      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You
      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a
      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to
      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been
      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but
      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a
      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed
      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those
      unreasoning but still highly useful, &lt;i&gt;multum in parvo&lt;/i&gt;, Sheffield
      contrivances, assuming the exterior&amp;mdash;though a little swelled&amp;mdash;of
      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,
      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,
      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the
      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of
      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,
      and there they were.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was,
      after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common
      soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its
      duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of
      hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided
      for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
      unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a
      great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel,
      which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box
      and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep
      himself awake.

      The Deck&amp;mdash;First Night Watch.
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
      lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly
      fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and
      various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame
      of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and
      that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
      shinbones. Let&amp;rsquo;s try another. Aye, now, this works better (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;).
      Halloa, this bone dust is (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;mdash;why it&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;mdash;yes
      it&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;mdash;bless my soul, it won&amp;rsquo;t let me speak! This is what an
      old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
      don&amp;rsquo;t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don&amp;rsquo;t get it (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;).
      Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let&amp;rsquo;s have that ferule
      and buckle-screw; I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;)
      there&amp;rsquo;s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere
      shinbone&amp;mdash;why it&amp;rsquo;s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to
      put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn
      him out as neat a leg now as ever (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;) scraped to a lady in a parlor.
      Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in shop windows wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
      compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and
      have to be doctored (&lt;i&gt;sneezes&lt;/i&gt;) with washes and lotions, just like live
      legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and
      see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.
      Ha! that&amp;rsquo;s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it&amp;rsquo;s somebody else,
      that&amp;rsquo;s certain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      AHAB (&lt;i&gt;advancing&lt;/i&gt;). (&lt;i&gt;During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
      sneezing at times.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Well, manmaker!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let
      me measure, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Measured for a leg! good. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not the first time. About it! There;
      keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter;
      let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, sir, it will break bones&amp;mdash;beware, beware!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
      world that can hold, man. What&amp;rsquo;s Prometheus about there?&amp;mdash;the
      blacksmith, I mean&amp;mdash;what&amp;rsquo;s he about?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Right. It&amp;rsquo;s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce
      red flame there!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
      Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith,
      and animated them with fire; for what&amp;rsquo;s made in fire must properly belong
      to fire; and so hell&amp;rsquo;s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the
      remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he&amp;rsquo;s through
      with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades;
      there&amp;rsquo;s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sir?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I&amp;rsquo;ll order a complete man after a
      desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
      modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to &amp;rsquo;em, to stay in
      one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass
      forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see&amp;mdash;shall
      I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head
      to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, what&amp;rsquo;s he speaking about, and who&amp;rsquo;s he speaking to, I should like to
      know? Shall I keep standing here? (&lt;i&gt;aside&lt;/i&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;rsquo;Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here&amp;rsquo;s one. No,
      no, no; I must have a lantern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ho, ho! That&amp;rsquo;s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted
      light is worse than presented pistols.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Carpenter? why that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;but no;&amp;mdash;a very tidy, and, I may say, an
      extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;&amp;mdash;or
      would&amp;rsquo;st thou rather work in clay?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sir?&amp;mdash;Clay? clay, sir? That&amp;rsquo;s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The fellow&amp;rsquo;s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bone is rather dusty, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
      living people&amp;rsquo;s noses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sir?&amp;mdash;oh! ah!&amp;mdash;I guess so;&amp;mdash;yes&amp;mdash;oh, dear!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
      workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy
      work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless
      feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter,
      my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive
      that old Adam away?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
      something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
      entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking
      him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;
      so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.
      Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,
      do I. Is&amp;rsquo;t a riddle?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
      may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
      thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
      solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don&amp;rsquo;t speak!
      And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long
      dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of
      hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I
      think I didn&amp;rsquo;t carry a small figure, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.&amp;mdash;How long before
      the leg is done?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Perhaps an hour, sir.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (&lt;i&gt;turns to go&lt;/i&gt;). Oh, Life! Here I
      am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a
      bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not
      do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I&amp;rsquo;m down in the whole
      world&amp;rsquo;s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the
      wealthiest PrÃ¦torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the
      world&amp;rsquo;s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
      heavens! I&amp;rsquo;ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one
      small, compendious vertebra. So.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      CARPENTER (&lt;i&gt;resuming his work&lt;/i&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he&amp;rsquo;s
      queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he&amp;rsquo;s queer,
      says Stubb; he&amp;rsquo;s queer&amp;mdash;queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr.
      Starbuck all the time&amp;mdash;queer&amp;mdash;sir&amp;mdash;queer, queer, very
      queer. And here&amp;rsquo;s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here&amp;rsquo;s his
      bedfellow! has a stick of whale&amp;rsquo;s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his
      leg; he&amp;rsquo;ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in
      three places, and all three places standing in one hell&amp;mdash;how was
      that? Oh! I don&amp;rsquo;t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I&amp;rsquo;m a sort of
      strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that&amp;rsquo;s only haphazard-like.
      Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out
      into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you
      under the chin pretty quick, and there&amp;rsquo;s a great cry for life-boats. And
      here&amp;rsquo;s the heron&amp;rsquo;s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks
      one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them
      mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old
      coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he&amp;rsquo;s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to
      death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the
      cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
      let&amp;rsquo;s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his
      horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old
      beer barrels, to fill &amp;rsquo;em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a
      real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he&amp;rsquo;ll be standing on
      this to-morrow; he&amp;rsquo;ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot
      the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
      So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
      inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
      sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the
      cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a
      regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the
      casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed
      by the ship&amp;rsquo;s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight;
      while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners
      readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
      the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the
      China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general
      chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another
      separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands&amp;mdash;Niphon,
      Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the
      screwed leg of his table, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in
      his hand, the wondrous old man, with his back to the gangway door, was
      wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old courses again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rdquo; hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to
      it. &amp;ldquo;On deck! Begone!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We
      must up Burtons and break out.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
      for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
      in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,
      sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;So it is, so it is; if we get it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!
      I&amp;rsquo;m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,
      but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that&amp;rsquo;s a far worse plight
      than the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s, man. Yet I don&amp;rsquo;t stop to plug my leak; for who can find
      it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in this
      life&amp;rsquo;s howling gale? Starbuck! I&amp;rsquo;ll not have the Burtons hoisted.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What will the owners say, sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
      cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about
      those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye,
      the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my
      conscience is in this ship&amp;rsquo;s keel.&amp;mdash;On deck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Captain Ahab,&amp;rdquo; said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
      with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
      not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of
      itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; &amp;ldquo;A
      better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
      enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?&amp;mdash;On
      deck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir&amp;mdash;to be
      forbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
      Captain Ahab?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
      South-Sea-men&amp;rsquo;s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
      exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain
      that is lord over the Pequod.&amp;mdash;On deck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you
      would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the
      levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he
      quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: &amp;ldquo;Thou hast outraged,
      not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck;
      thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself,
      old man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!&amp;rdquo;
       murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that he said&amp;mdash;Ahab
      beware of Ahab&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s something there!&amp;rdquo; Then unconsciously using
      the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
      little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
      returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,&amp;rdquo; he said lowly to the mate;
      then raising his voice to the crew: &amp;ldquo;Furl the t&amp;rsquo;gallant-sails, and
      close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and
      break out in the main-hold.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
      Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or
      mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade
      the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the
      important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were
      executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.

      CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were
      perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm
      weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the
      huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those
      gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so
      ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,
      that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing
      coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning
      the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of
      water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of
      hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get
      about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over
      empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted
      demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all
      Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them
      then.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
      bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to
      his endless end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
      dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher
      you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer,
      must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but&amp;mdash;as we have
      elsewhere seen&amp;mdash;mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally
      descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that
      subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and
      see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the
      holders, so called.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have
      stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped
      to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that
      dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.
      And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,
      strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible
      chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days&amp;rsquo; suffering,
      laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How
      he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there
      seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else
      in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,
      seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of
      lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a
      wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or
      be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter,
      expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of
      Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by
      the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as
      any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
      wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
      the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
      with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
      adequately tell. So that&amp;mdash;let us say it again&amp;mdash;no dying Chaldee
      or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious
      shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay
      in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to
      his final rest, and the ocean&amp;rsquo;s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
      higher towards his destined heaven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
      he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He
      called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just
      breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced
      to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his
      native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died
      in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of
      being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of
      his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in
      his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;
      for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond
      all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with
      the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He
      added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
      according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
      death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket,
      all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat
      these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but
      uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was
      at once commanded to do Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s bidding, whatever it might include.
      There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon
      a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the
      Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to
      be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking
      his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his
      character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s measure with
      great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s person as he shifted the
      rule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ah! poor fellow! he&amp;rsquo;ll have to die now,&amp;rdquo; ejaculated the Long Island
      sailor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
      reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
      was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at
      its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to
      work.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
      lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether
      they were ready for it yet in that direction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on
      deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one&amp;rsquo;s
      consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
      him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
      dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly
      trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
      attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn
      from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of
      the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then
      ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the
      head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;
      and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now
      entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its
      comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told
      one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his
      arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch
      he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a
      leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his
      composed countenance in view. &amp;ldquo;Rarmai&amp;rdquo; (it will do; it is easy), he
      murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
      while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by
      the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go
      ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the
      beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for
      me? Seek out one Pip, who&amp;rsquo;s now been missing long: I think he&amp;rsquo;s in those
      far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad;
      for look! he&amp;rsquo;s left his tambourine behind;&amp;mdash;I found it. Rig-a-dig,
      dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I&amp;rsquo;ll beat ye your dying march.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I have heard,&amp;rdquo; murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, &amp;ldquo;that in
      violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
      that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly
      forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their
      hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this
      strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our
      heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?&amp;mdash;Hark! he speaks
      again: but more wildly now.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Form two and two! Let&amp;rsquo;s make a General of him! Ho, where&amp;rsquo;s his harpoon?
      Lay it across here.&amp;mdash;Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
      now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!&amp;mdash;mind ye that;
      Queequeg dies game!&amp;mdash;take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
      say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
      a&amp;rsquo;shiver;&amp;mdash;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
      Antilles he&amp;rsquo;s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped
      from a whale-boat! I&amp;rsquo;d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
      him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all
      cowards&amp;mdash;shame upon them! Let &amp;rsquo;em go drown like Pip, that jumped from
      a whale-boat. Shame! shame!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was
      led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
      his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there
      seemed no need of the carpenter&amp;rsquo;s box: and thereupon, when some expressed
      their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his
      sudden convalescence was this;&amp;mdash;at a critical moment, he had just
      recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore
      had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They
      asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign
      will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s
      conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not
      kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
      unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
      that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally
      speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good
      time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the
      windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he
      suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a
      good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of
      his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a
      fight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
      emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many
      spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque
      figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his
      rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this
      tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,
      who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete
      theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of
      attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to
      unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even
      himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
      mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the
      living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
      last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild
      exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor
      Queequeg&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!&amp;rdquo;

      CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
      Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific
      with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was
      answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of
      blue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
      awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
      fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
      John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
      prairies and Potters&amp;rsquo; Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise
      and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades
      and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call
      lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in
      their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
      ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the
      world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves
      wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted
      by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts
      of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between float milky-ways
      of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and
      impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the
      world&amp;rsquo;s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the
      tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs
      must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab&amp;rsquo;s brain, as standing like an iron
      statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril
      he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose
      sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously
      inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated
      White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at length upon these
      almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the
      old man&amp;rsquo;s purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a
      vice; the Delta of his forehead&amp;rsquo;s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in
      his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, &amp;ldquo;Stern all!
      the White Whale spouts thick blood!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
      these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
      shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith,
      had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his
      contributory work for Ahab&amp;rsquo;s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast
      lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked
      by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for
      them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and
      boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all
      waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and
      lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.
      Nevertheless, this old man&amp;rsquo;s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient
      arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent,
      slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back,
      he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his
      hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.&amp;mdash;Most
      miserable!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
      yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
      curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
      questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
      one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter&amp;rsquo;s midnight, on the road
      running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the
      deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
      dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet.
      Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of
      the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of
      the grief of his life&amp;rsquo;s drama.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
      encountered that thing in sorrow&amp;rsquo;s technicals called ruin. He had been an
      artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and
      garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe,
      ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in
      a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in
      a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home,
      and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith
      himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family&amp;rsquo;s heart. It
      was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew
      the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and
      economic reasons, the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s shop was in the basement of his
      dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young
      and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with
      vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband&amp;rsquo;s
      hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and
      walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout
      Labor&amp;rsquo;s iron lullaby, the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s infants were rocked to slumber.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst
      thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him,
      then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly
      venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of
      them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder
      brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of
      some other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till
      the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
      and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the
      wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing
      into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked
      up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into the long
      church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the
      houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every
      woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is
      only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the
      first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the
      Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men,
      who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide,
      does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth
      his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life
      adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand
      mermaids sing to them&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another
      life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders
      supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life
      which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more
      oblivious than death. Come hither! put up &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; gravestone, too, within the
      churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall
      of eve, the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went
      a-whaling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
      mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed
      upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and
      with the other at his forge&amp;rsquo;s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along,
      carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a
      little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,
      withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil&amp;mdash;the
      red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which
      flew close to Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Are these thy Mother Carey&amp;rsquo;s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in
      thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;&amp;mdash;look here, they
      burn; but thou&amp;mdash;thou liv&amp;rsquo;st among them without a scorch.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,&amp;rdquo; answered Perth, resting
      for a moment on his hammer; &amp;ldquo;I am past scorching; not easily can&amp;rsquo;st thou
      scorch a scar.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to
      me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is
      not mad. Thou should&amp;rsquo;st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?
      How can&amp;rsquo;st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,
      that thou can&amp;rsquo;st not go mad?&amp;mdash;What wert thou making there?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And can&amp;rsquo;st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
      usage as it had?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I think so, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And I suppose thou can&amp;rsquo;st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind
      how hard the metal, blacksmith?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look ye here, then,&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with
      both hands on Perth&amp;rsquo;s shoulders; &amp;ldquo;look ye here&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;can ye
      smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,&amp;rdquo; sweeping one hand across his
      ribbed brow; &amp;ldquo;if thou could&amp;rsquo;st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
      head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer!
      Can&amp;rsquo;st thou smoothe this seam?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though
      thou only see&amp;rsquo;st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of
      my skull&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is all wrinkles! But, away with child&amp;rsquo;s play; no more
      gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!&amp;rdquo; jingling the leathern bag, as if it
      were full of gold coins. &amp;ldquo;I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand
      yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale
      like his own fin-bone. There&amp;rsquo;s the stuff,&amp;rdquo; flinging the pouch upon the
      anvil. &amp;ldquo;Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the
      steel shoes of racing horses.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best
      and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
      melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
      first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these
      twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I&amp;rsquo;ll blow
      the fire.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
      spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. &amp;ldquo;A
      flaw!&amp;rdquo; rejecting the last one. &amp;ldquo;Work that over again, Perth.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab
      stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with
      regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the
      glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up
      its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over
      his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on
      the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?&amp;rdquo; muttered Stubb,
      looking on from the forecastle. &amp;ldquo;That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and
      smells of it himself, like a hot musket&amp;rsquo;s powder-pan.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
      Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
      by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab&amp;rsquo;s bent face.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Would&amp;rsquo;st thou brand me, Perth?&amp;rdquo; wincing for a moment with the pain; &amp;ldquo;have
      I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
      harpoon for the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,
      man. Here are my razors&amp;mdash;the best of steel; here, and make the barbs
      sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
      not use them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
      nor pray till&amp;mdash;but here&amp;mdash;to work!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank,
      the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was
      about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried
      to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, no&amp;mdash;no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
      there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as
      much blood as will cover this barb?&amp;rdquo; holding it high up. A cluster of dark
      nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the
      White Whale&amp;rsquo;s barbs were then tempered.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!&amp;rdquo; deliriously
      howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal
      blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,
      with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the
      iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it
      taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot
      upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending
      over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;Good! and now for the
      seizings.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
      were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was
      then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was
      traced half-way along the pole&amp;rsquo;s length, and firmly secured so, with
      intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope&amp;mdash;like the
      Three Fates&amp;mdash;remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
      the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
      both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,
      light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
      Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange
      mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy
      ship, and mocked it!

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
      ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
      pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
      stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or
      paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes
      calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their
      pains.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
      heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
      sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
      cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
      quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean&amp;rsquo;s
      skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not
      willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
      certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
      regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only
      the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high rolling
      waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when the
      western emigrants&amp;rsquo; horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden
      bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there
      steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie
      sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of
      the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so
      that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one
      seamless whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
      temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to
      open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them
      prove but tarnishing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&amp;mdash;though
      long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,&amp;mdash;in ye, men yet
      may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few
      fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to
      God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of
      life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for
      every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do
      not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:&amp;mdash;through
      infancy&amp;rsquo;s unconscious spell, boyhood&amp;rsquo;s thoughtless faith, adolescence&amp;rsquo; 
      doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last
      in manhood&amp;rsquo;s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the
      round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies
      the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the
      world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling&amp;rsquo;s
      father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die
      in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we
      must there to learn it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat&amp;rsquo;s side into that
      same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride&amp;rsquo;s eye!&amp;mdash;Tell
      me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let
      faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden
      light:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he
      has always been jolly!&amp;rdquo;

      And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
      before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab&amp;rsquo;s harpoon had been welded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last
      cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad
      holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing
      round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing
      her prow for home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
      at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;
      and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
      last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were
      flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her
      three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her
      top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid;
      and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
      success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas
      numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single
      fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room
      for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had
      been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along
      the deck, and in the captain&amp;rsquo;s and officers&amp;rsquo; state-rooms. Even the cabin
      table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined
      off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
      centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and
      pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the
      cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the
      steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the
      harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that
      indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain&amp;rsquo;s pantaloons
      pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in
      self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
      barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
      still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
      try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like &lt;i&gt;poke&lt;/i&gt; or stomach skin of
      the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
      hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were
      dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the
      Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
      aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with
      glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
      jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship&amp;rsquo;s company were tumultuously busy at the
      masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You
      would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
      wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being
      hurled into the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before
      him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with
      a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other&amp;rsquo;s wakes&amp;mdash;one
      all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things
      to come&amp;mdash;their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole
      striking contrast of the scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Come aboard, come aboard!&amp;rdquo; cried the gay Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s commander, lifting a
      glass and a bottle in the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo; gritted Ahab in reply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No; only heard of him; but don&amp;rsquo;t believe in him at all,&amp;rdquo; said the other
      good-humoredly. &amp;ldquo;Come aboard!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not enough to speak of&amp;mdash;two islanders, that&amp;rsquo;s all;&amp;mdash;but come
      aboard, old hearty, come along. I&amp;rsquo;ll soon take that black from your brow.
      Come along, will ye (merry&amp;rsquo;s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;How wondrous familiar is a fool!&amp;rdquo; muttered Ahab; then aloud, &amp;ldquo;Thou art a
      full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty
      ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!
      Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
      stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of
      the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding
      Bachelor; but the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s men never heeding their gaze for the lively
      revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
      homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
      then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote
      associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.

      CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune&amp;rsquo;s favourites
      sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
      rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it
      with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales
      were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson
      fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and
      whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such
      plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that
      it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the
      Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone
      to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off
      from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
      tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
      dying&amp;mdash;the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring&amp;mdash;that
      strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
      conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He turns and turns him to it,&amp;mdash;how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
      homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
      worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!&amp;mdash;Oh
      that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look!
      here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most
      candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets;
      where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless
      and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the Niger&amp;rsquo;s unknown source;
      here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than
      death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
      thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou
      art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
      wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
      has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
      again, without a lesson to me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed
      jet!&amp;mdash;that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh
      whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only
      calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock
      me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float
      beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as
      air, but water now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl
      finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill
      and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
      windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last
      three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not
      be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side
      all night; and that boat was Ahab&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale&amp;rsquo;s spout-hole; and the
      lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the
      black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently
      chafed the whale&amp;rsquo;s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab and all his boat&amp;rsquo;s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
      in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
      whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like
      the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
      Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped
      round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded
      world. &amp;ldquo;I have dreamed it again,&amp;rdquo; said he.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin
      can be thine?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And who are hearsed that die on the sea?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
      hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
      mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
      America.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:&amp;mdash;a hearse and its plumes
      floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
      sight we shall not soon see.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And what was that saying about thyself?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And when thou art so gone before&amp;mdash;if that ever befall&amp;mdash;then ere
      I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?&amp;mdash;Was
      it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here
      two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Take another pledge, old man,&amp;rdquo; said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
      like fire-flies in the gloom&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Hemp only can kill thee.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The gallows, ye mean.&amp;mdash;I am immortal then, on land and on sea,&amp;rdquo;
       cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Immortal on land and on sea!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
      slumbering crew arose from the boat&amp;rsquo;s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale
      was brought to the ship.

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
      coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
      ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
      the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on
      the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship&amp;rsquo;s prow for
      the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and
      Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his
      wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
      effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus
      of the glassy ocean&amp;rsquo;s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered;
      clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of
      unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God&amp;rsquo;s throne. Well
      that Ahab&amp;rsquo;s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to
      take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of
      the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye,
      he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant
      when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole
      attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab&amp;rsquo;s, was eyeing the same sun with
      him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face
      was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
      observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon
      calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling
      into a moment&amp;rsquo;s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to
      himself: &amp;ldquo;Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly
      where I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;but canst thou cast the least hint where I &lt;i&gt;shall&lt;/i&gt; be? Or
      canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living?
      Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of
      mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into
      the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
      thither side of thee, thou sun!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
      numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
      &amp;ldquo;Foolish toy! babies&amp;rsquo; plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and
      Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what
      after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
      thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee:
      no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one
      grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou
      insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all
      the things that cast man&amp;rsquo;s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness
      but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light,
      O sun! Level by nature to this earth&amp;rsquo;s horizon are the glances of man&amp;rsquo;s
      eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze
      on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!&amp;rdquo; dashing it to the deck, &amp;ldquo;no
      longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship&amp;rsquo;s compass, and
      the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; shall conduct me, and
      show me my place on the sea. Aye,&amp;rdquo; lighting from the boat to the deck,
      &amp;ldquo;thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;
      thus I split and destroy thee!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead
      feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic
      despair that seemed meant for himself&amp;mdash;these passed over the mute,
      motionless Parsee&amp;rsquo;s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while,
      awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together
      on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;To
      the braces! Up helm!&amp;mdash;square in!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her
      heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long,
      ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient
      steed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      tumultuous way, and Ahab&amp;rsquo;s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of
      its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,
      to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what
      will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;but sea-coal ashes&amp;mdash;mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck&amp;mdash;sea-coal,
      not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, &amp;lsquo;Here some one
      thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play
      them, and no others.&amp;rsquo; And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in
      the game, and die in it!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;

      CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches
      in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket
      the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept
      tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese
      seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will
      sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a
      dazed and sleepy town.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
      bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
      ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
      thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
      fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
      tempest had left for its after sport.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every
      flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
      might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were
      directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.
      But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the
      cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab&amp;rsquo;s) did not escape. A great rolling
      sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship&amp;rsquo;s high teetering side, stove
      in the boat&amp;rsquo;s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through
      like a sieve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, regarding the wreck, &amp;ldquo;but
      the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can&amp;rsquo;t fight it. You see, Mr.
      Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round
      the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start
      I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never mind; it&amp;rsquo;s all
      in fun: so the old song says;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;(&lt;i&gt;sings&lt;/i&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre xml:space=&#34;preserve&#34;&gt;
  Oh! jolly is the gale,
  And a joker is the whale,
  A&amp;rsquo; flourishin&amp;rsquo; his tail,&amp;mdash;
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  The scud all a flyin&amp;rsquo;,
  That&amp;rsquo;s his flip only foamin&amp;rsquo;;
  When he stirs in the spicin&amp;rsquo;,&amp;mdash;
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  Thunder splits the ships,
  But he only smacks his lips,
  A tastin&amp;rsquo; of this flip,&amp;mdash;
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast Stubb,&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp
      here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
      peace.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
      and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck,
      there&amp;rsquo;s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And
      when that&amp;rsquo;s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
      mind how foolish?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Here!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
      hand towards the weather bow, &amp;ldquo;markest thou not that the gale comes from
      the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very
      course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that
      stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand&amp;mdash;his
      stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
      must!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t half understand ye: what&amp;rsquo;s in the wind?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,&amp;rdquo;
       soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb&amp;rsquo;s question. &amp;ldquo;The gale
      that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that
      will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom;
      but to leeward, homeward&amp;mdash;I see it lightens up there; but not with
      the lightning.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the
      flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a
      volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Old Thunder!&amp;rdquo; said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
      pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
      lances of fire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the
      perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships
      carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this
      conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all
      contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there,
      it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with
      some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel&amp;rsquo;s way in the
      water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship&amp;rsquo;s lightning-rods are
      not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as
      to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down
      into the sea, as occasion may require.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The rods! the rods!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to
      vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to
      light Ahab to his post. &amp;ldquo;Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft.
      Quick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab; &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s have fair play here, though we be the weaker
      side. Yet I&amp;rsquo;ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that
      all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look aloft!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck. &amp;ldquo;The corpusants! the corpusants!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
      tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
      the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
      three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Blast the boat! let it go!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
      sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
      jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. &amp;ldquo;Blast it!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but
      slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
      immediately shifting his tone he cried&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;The corpusants have mercy on
      us all!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
      the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from
      the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but
      in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God&amp;rsquo;s burning
      finger has been laid on the ship; when His &amp;ldquo;Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin&amp;rdquo;
       has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
      enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
      their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
      constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic
      jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the
      black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego
      revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had
      been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light,
      Queequeg&amp;rsquo;s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the
      Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two
      passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was
      Stubb. &amp;ldquo;What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same
      in the song.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope
      they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?&amp;mdash;have
      they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck&amp;mdash;but it&amp;rsquo;s too
      dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
      of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
      chock a&amp;rsquo; block with sperm-oil, d&amp;rsquo;ye see; and so, all that sperm will work
      up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as
      three spermaceti candles&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s the good promise we saw.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb&amp;rsquo;s face slowly beginning to
      glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: &amp;ldquo;See! see!&amp;rdquo; and once more
      the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
      supernaturalness in their pallor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The corpusants have mercy on us all,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the
      Parsee was kneeling in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s front, but with his head bowed away from
      him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they
      had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by
      the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed
      wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like
      the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others
      remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, men!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab. &amp;ldquo;Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame
      but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there;
      I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against
      fire! So.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Then turning&amp;mdash;the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
      foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
      he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once
      did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this
      hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know
      that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt
      thou be kind; and e&amp;rsquo;en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.
      No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power;
      but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional,
      unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a
      personality stands here. Though but a point at best; whencesoe&amp;rsquo;er I came;
      wheresoe&amp;rsquo;er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives
      in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come
      in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
      highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of
      full-freighted worlds, there&amp;rsquo;s that in here that still remains
      indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a
      true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      [&lt;i&gt;Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to
      thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his
      right hand pressed hard upon them.&lt;/i&gt;]
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
      from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then
      grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of
      these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning
      flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten
      brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet
      blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out
      of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!
      The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh,
      thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my
      fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done
      with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how
      came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
      beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou
      knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing
      thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but
      time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my
      scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit
      immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated
      grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and
      lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded
      with thee; defyingly I worship thee!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The boat! the boat!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;look at thy boat, old man!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab&amp;rsquo;s harpoon, the one forged at Perth&amp;rsquo;s fire, remained firmly lashed in
      its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat&amp;rsquo;s bow;
      but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath
      to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame
      of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent&amp;rsquo;s
      tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;God, God is against thee,
      old man; forbear! &amp;rsquo;tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me
      square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it
      homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces&amp;mdash;though
      not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate&amp;rsquo;s thoughts
      seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling
      lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved
      it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor
      that but cast loose a rope&amp;rsquo;s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more
      shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay,
      and Ahab again spoke:&amp;mdash;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart,
      soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to
      what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!&amp;rdquo;
       And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
      some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so
      much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so
      at those last words of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s many of the mariners did run from him in a
      terror of dismay.

    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose

     &lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
      but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.&amp;mdash;By
      masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting
      smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were
      made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the
      cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their
      brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e&amp;rsquo;en
      take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh,

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over the
      anchors there hanging.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you
      will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago
      is it since you said the very contrary? Didn&amp;rsquo;t you once say that whatever
      ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance
      policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of
      lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn&amp;rsquo;t you say so?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well, suppose I did? What then? I&amp;rsquo;ve part changed my flesh since that
      time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; loaded with powder
      barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
      afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
      red hair, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t get afire now. Shake yourself; you&amp;rsquo;re Aquarius,
      or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don&amp;rsquo;t
      you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies
      have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I&amp;rsquo;ll
      answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the
      anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What&amp;rsquo;s the mighty
      difference between holding a mast&amp;rsquo;s lightning-rod in the storm, and
      standing close by a mast that hasn&amp;rsquo;t got any lightning-rod at all in a
      storm? Don&amp;rsquo;t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder
      of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about,
      then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,&amp;mdash;aye, man,
      and all of us,&amp;mdash;were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than
      all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you
      King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about
      with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a
      militia officer&amp;rsquo;s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
      don&amp;rsquo;t ye be sensible, Flask? it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be sensible; why don&amp;rsquo;t ye, then?
      any man with half an eye can be sensible.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Yes, when a fellow&amp;rsquo;s soaked through, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be sensible, that&amp;rsquo;s a
      fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn
      there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as
      if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here,
      Flask, seems like tying a man&amp;rsquo;s hands behind him. And what big generous
      hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold
      they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;
      if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer
      that knot down, and we&amp;rsquo;ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on
      deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts,
      will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
      long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails
      tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d&amp;rsquo;ye see. Same with
      cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more
      monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and
      drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard;
      Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
      This is a nasty night, lad.&amp;rdquo;

      CHAPTER 123. The Musket.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its
      spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it&amp;mdash;for
      they were slack&amp;mdash;because some play to the tiller was indispensable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to
      the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses,
      at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s; at almost
      every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity
      with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone
      can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
      strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb&amp;mdash;one engaged forward and
      the other aft&amp;mdash;the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
      main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to
      leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to
      the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
      storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the
      water with some precision again; and the course&amp;mdash;for the present,
      East-south-east&amp;mdash;which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
      given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
      steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship
      as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good
      sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became
      fair!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Ho! the fair
      wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; the crew singing for joy, that so promising
      an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In compliance with the standing order of his commander&amp;mdash;to report
      immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change
      in the affairs of the deck,&amp;mdash;Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards
      to the breeze&amp;mdash;however reluctantly and gloomily,&amp;mdash;than he
      mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
      moment. The cabin lamp&amp;mdash;taking long swings this way and that&amp;mdash;was
      burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man&amp;rsquo;s bolted
      door,&amp;mdash;a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper
      panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
      silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
      elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they
      stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,
      upright man; but out of Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s heart, at that instant when he saw the
      muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its
      neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for
      itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He would have shot me once,&amp;rdquo; he murmured, &amp;ldquo;yes, there&amp;rsquo;s the very musket
      that he pointed at me;&amp;mdash;that one with the studded stock; let me touch
      it&amp;mdash;lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,
      strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and
      powder in the pan;&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s not good. Best spill it?&amp;mdash;wait. I&amp;rsquo;ll
      cure myself of this. I&amp;rsquo;ll hold the musket boldly while I think.&amp;mdash;I
      come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/i&gt;
      fair for Moby Dick. It&amp;rsquo;s a fair wind that&amp;rsquo;s only fair for that accursed
      fish.&amp;mdash;The very tube he pointed at me!&amp;mdash;the very one; &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; one&amp;mdash;I
      hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.&amp;mdash;Aye
      and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike
      his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in
      these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of
      the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
      he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely
      suffered to drag a whole ship&amp;rsquo;s company down to doom with him?&amp;mdash;Yes,
      it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship
      come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship
      will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant&amp;mdash;put
      aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes,
      just there,&amp;mdash;in there, he&amp;rsquo;s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive,
      and soon awake again. I can&amp;rsquo;t withstand thee, then, old man. Not
      reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this
      thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou
      breathest. Aye, and say&amp;rsquo;st the men have vow&amp;rsquo;d thy vow; say&amp;rsquo;st all of us
      are Ahabs. Great God forbid!&amp;mdash;But is there no other way? no lawful
      way?&amp;mdash;Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this
      old man&amp;rsquo;s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try
      it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
      chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous
      than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly
      fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would
      leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
      hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here
      upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and
      law.&amp;mdash;Aye, aye, &amp;rsquo;tis so.&amp;mdash;Is heaven a murderer when its
      lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and
      skin together?&amp;mdash;And would I be a murderer, then, if&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and
      slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded
      musket&amp;rsquo;s end against the door.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;On this level, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch,
      and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.&amp;mdash;Oh Mary!
      Mary!&amp;mdash;boy! boy! boy!&amp;mdash;But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
      who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s body this day week may
      sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall I?&amp;mdash;The
      wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed
      and set; she heads her course.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man&amp;rsquo;s
      tormented sleep, as if Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s voice had caused the long dumb dream to
      speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard&amp;rsquo;s arm against the panel;
      Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
      placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
      him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know&amp;rsquo;st what to say.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
      mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s gurgling track, pushed her on
      like giants&amp;rsquo; palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,
      that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed
      before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was
      only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays
      moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and
      queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold,
      that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
      the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
      the bright sun&amp;rsquo;s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
      the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun&amp;rsquo;s rearward place, and how the
      same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
      the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
      Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
      helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;East-sou-east, sir,&amp;rdquo; said the frightened steersman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou liest!&amp;rdquo; smiting him with his clenched fist. &amp;ldquo;Heading East at this
      hour in the morning, and the sun astern?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed
      by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding
      palpableness must have been the cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of
      the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed
      to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses
      pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old
      man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;I have it! It has happened before. Mr.
      Starbuck, last night&amp;rsquo;s thunder turned our compasses&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s all. Thou
      hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,&amp;rdquo; said the pale mate,
      gloomily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
      one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
      developed in the mariner&amp;rsquo;s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
      the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at,
      that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually
      struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the
      effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its
      loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was
      of no more use than an old wife&amp;rsquo;s knitting needle. But in either case, the
      needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
      lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all
      the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted
      into the kelson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
      compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the
      precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly
      inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship&amp;rsquo;s course to be changed
      accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her
      undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only
      been juggling her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
      but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask&amp;mdash;who
      in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings&amp;mdash;likewise
      unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly
      rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
      ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or
      if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
      congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab&amp;rsquo;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing
      to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the
      quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun&amp;rsquo;s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,
      and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is
      lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck&amp;mdash;a lance without a
      pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker&amp;rsquo;s needles. Quick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to
      do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
      revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
      matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man
      well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
      practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
      without some shudderings and evil portents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Men,&amp;rdquo; said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the
      things he had demanded, &amp;ldquo;my men, the thunder turned old Ahab&amp;rsquo;s needles;
      but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point
      as true as any.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this
      was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
      follow. But Starbuck looked away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
      lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him
      hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after
      repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted
      needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several
      times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some
      small strange motions with it&amp;mdash;whether indispensable to the
      magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the
      crew, is uncertain&amp;mdash;he called for linen thread; and moving to the
      binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
      suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At
      first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either
      end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently
      watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and
      pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Look ye, for
      yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East,
      and that compass swears it!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
      persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal
      pride.

      CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
      and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
      upon other means of determining the vessel&amp;rsquo;s place, some merchantmen, and
      many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;
      though at the same time, and frequently more for form&amp;rsquo;s sake than anything
      else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered
      by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every
      hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log
      attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after
      bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all
      the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But heedless
      of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
      not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant
      was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line.
      The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Forward, there! Heave the log!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. &amp;ldquo;Take
      the reel, one of ye, I&amp;rsquo;ll heave.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship&amp;rsquo;s lee side, where the
      deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the
      creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
      handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
      stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
      turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
      Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
      speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
      spoiled it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
      Thou seem&amp;rsquo;st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs
      of mine &amp;rsquo;tis not worth while disputing, &amp;rsquo;specially with a superior, who&amp;rsquo;ll
      ne&amp;rsquo;er confess.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that? There now&amp;rsquo;s a patched professor in Queen Nature&amp;rsquo;s
      granite-founded College; but methinks he&amp;rsquo;s too subservient. Where wert
      thou born?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Excellent! Thou&amp;rsquo;st hit the world by that.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I know not, sir, but I was born there.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it&amp;rsquo;s good. Here&amp;rsquo;s a man
      from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
      which is sucked in&amp;mdash;by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
      butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
      dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
      turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
      resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hold hard!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging
      log was gone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea
      parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel
      up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend
      thou the line. See to it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There he goes now; to him nothing&amp;rsquo;s happened; but to me, the skewer seems
      loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!
      These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging
      slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip&amp;rsquo;s missing.
      Let&amp;rsquo;s see now if ye haven&amp;rsquo;t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard;
      I guess he&amp;rsquo;s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no
      cowards here. Ho! there&amp;rsquo;s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a
      hatchet! cut it off&amp;mdash;we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
      sir! here&amp;rsquo;s Pip, trying to get on board again.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Peace, thou crazy loon,&amp;rdquo; cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. &amp;ldquo;Away
      from the quarter-deck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,&amp;rdquo; muttered Ahab, advancing.
      &amp;ldquo;Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
      thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
      through! Who art thou, boy?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bell-boy, sir; ship&amp;rsquo;s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred
      pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high&amp;mdash;looks cowardly&amp;mdash;quickest
      known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who&amp;rsquo;s seen Pip the coward?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look
      down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye
      creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab&amp;rsquo;s cabin shall be Pip&amp;rsquo;s home
      henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou
      art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let&amp;rsquo;s down.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this? here&amp;rsquo;s velvet shark-skin,&amp;rdquo; intently gazing at Ahab&amp;rsquo;s hand,
      and feeling it. &amp;ldquo;Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,
      perhaps he had ne&amp;rsquo;er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
      something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and
      rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will
      not let this go.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
      horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods
      all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
      oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what
      he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel
      prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
      Emperor&amp;rsquo;s!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There go two daft ones now,&amp;rdquo; muttered the old Manxman. &amp;ldquo;One daft with
      strength, the other daft with weakness. But here&amp;rsquo;s the end of the rotten
      line&amp;mdash;all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new
      line altogether. I&amp;rsquo;ll see Mr. Stubb about it.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Steering now south-eastward by Ahab&amp;rsquo;s levelled steel, and her progress
      solely determined by Ahab&amp;rsquo;s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
      path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
      unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
      by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed
      the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
      Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
      dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch&amp;mdash;then
      headed by Flask&amp;mdash;was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
      unearthly&amp;mdash;like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
      Herod&amp;rsquo;s murdered Innocents&amp;mdash;that one and all, they started from their
      reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
      transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry
      remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said
      it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained
      unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman&amp;mdash;the oldest mariner of all&amp;mdash;declared
      that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly
      drowned men in the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
      came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied
      with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the
      wonder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
      of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that
      had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with
      her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the
      more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very
      superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar
      tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads
      and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water
      alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than
      once been mistaken for men.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
      confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise
      this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether
      it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors
      sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus with the
      man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long
      at his perch, when a cry was heard&amp;mdash;a cry and a rushing&amp;mdash;and
      looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a
      little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The life-buoy&amp;mdash;a long slender cask&amp;mdash;was dropped from the stern,
      where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
      seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so
      that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every
      pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom,
      as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for
      the White Whale, on the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s own peculiar ground; that man was
      swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.
      Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a
      portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the
      future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared
      that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the
      night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to
      it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the
      feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage,
      all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with
      its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going
      to leave the ship&amp;rsquo;s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange
      signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;A life-buoy of a coffin!&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, starting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Rather queer, that, I should say,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;It will make a good enough one,&amp;rdquo; said Flask, &amp;ldquo;the carpenter here can
      arrange it easily.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bring it up; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else for it,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck, after a
      melancholy pause. &amp;ldquo;Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so&amp;mdash;the
      coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And shall I nail down the lid, sir?&amp;rdquo; moving his hand as with a hammer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And shall I caulk the seams, sir?&amp;rdquo; moving his hand as with a
      caulking-iron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?&amp;rdquo; moving his hand as
      with a pitch-pot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no
      more.&amp;mdash;Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.
      Now I don&amp;rsquo;t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like
      a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won&amp;rsquo;t put his head
      into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I&amp;rsquo;m
      ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It&amp;rsquo;s like turning an old coat; going to
      bring the flesh on the other side now. I don&amp;rsquo;t like this cobbling sort of
      business&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all; it&amp;rsquo;s undignified; it&amp;rsquo;s not my
      place. Let tinkers&amp;rsquo; brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to
      take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,
      something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle
      when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler&amp;rsquo;s job,
      that&amp;rsquo;s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It&amp;rsquo;s the
      old woman&amp;rsquo;s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all
      old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away
      with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that&amp;rsquo;s the reason I never would
      work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off
      with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.
      Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten
      them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship&amp;rsquo;s stern.
      Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old
      carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the
      job. But I&amp;rsquo;m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don&amp;rsquo;t budge. Cruppered
      with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We
      workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins
      and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not
      for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too
      confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I&amp;rsquo;ll do the job,
      now, tenderly. I&amp;rsquo;ll have me&amp;mdash;let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;mdash;how many in the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      company, all told? But I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten. Any way, I&amp;rsquo;ll have me thirty
      separate, Turk&amp;rsquo;s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round
      to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there&amp;rsquo;ll be thirty lively
      fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath
      the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let&amp;rsquo;s
      to it.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open
      hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum
      slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.&amp;mdash;Ahab
      comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
      complies with my humor more genially than that boy.&amp;mdash;Middle aisle of
      a church! What&amp;rsquo;s here?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
      hatchway!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
      they&amp;rsquo;ve set me now to turning it into something else.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
      monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
      next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
      same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
      jack-of-all-trades.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?
      The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for
      volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost
      thou never?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the
      reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was
      none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to
      it.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, and that&amp;rsquo;s because the lid there&amp;rsquo;s a sounding-board; and what in all
      things makes the sounding-board is this&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s naught beneath. And
      yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
      Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the
      churchyard gate, going in?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Faith, sir, I&amp;rsquo;ve&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Faith? What&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why, faith, sir, it&amp;rsquo;s only a sort of exclamation-like&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s all,
      sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Um, um; go on.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I was about to say, sir, that&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look
      at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
      latitudes. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos,
      is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of
      Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He&amp;rsquo;s always under the
      Line&amp;mdash;fiery hot, I tell ye! He&amp;rsquo;s looking this way&amp;mdash;come, oakum;
      quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I&amp;rsquo;m the

      tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
      thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that
      fellow. Rat-tat! So man&amp;rsquo;s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
      materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
      now&amp;rsquo;s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
      expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy
      of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense
      the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I&amp;rsquo;ll think of
      that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other
      side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will
      ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let
      me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk
      this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown
      conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!&amp;rdquo;

      CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
      upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
      the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
      broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
      fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the
      smitten hull.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Bad news; she brings bad news,&amp;rdquo; muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
      commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could
      hopefully hail, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s voice was heard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and
      would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
      himself, having stopped his vessel&amp;rsquo;s way, was seen descending her side. A
      few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s main-chains,
      and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a
      Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Where was he?&amp;mdash;not killed!&amp;mdash;not killed!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, closely
      advancing. &amp;ldquo;How was it?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
      three of the stranger&amp;rsquo;s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
      had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were
      yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had
      suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,
      the fourth rigged boat&amp;mdash;a reserved one&amp;mdash;had been instantly
      lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat&amp;mdash;the
      swiftest keeled of all&amp;mdash;seemed to have succeeded in fastening&amp;mdash;at
      least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.
      In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam
      of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was
      concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his
      pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive
      alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness
      came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats&amp;mdash;ere
      going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction&amp;mdash;the
      ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till
      near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. But
      the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail&amp;mdash;stunsail
      on stunsail&amp;mdash;after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots
      for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when
      she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of
      the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare
      boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed
      on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued
      doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had
      been seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
      object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own
      in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on
      parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I will wager something now,&amp;rdquo; whispered Stubb to Flask, &amp;ldquo;that some one in
      that missing boat wore off that Captain&amp;rsquo;s best coat; mayhap, his watch&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s
      so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships
      cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?
      See, Flask, only see how pale he looks&amp;mdash;pale in the very buttons of
      his eyes&amp;mdash;look&amp;mdash;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the coat&amp;mdash;it must have been the&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;My boy, my own boy is among them. For God&amp;rsquo;s sake&amp;mdash;I beg, I conjure&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;here
      exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily
      received his petition. &amp;ldquo;For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship&amp;mdash;I
      will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it&amp;mdash;if there be no other
      way&amp;mdash;for eight-and-forty hours only&amp;mdash;only that&amp;mdash;you must,
      oh, you must, and you &lt;i&gt;shall&lt;/i&gt; do this thing.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;His son!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;oh, it&amp;rsquo;s his son he&amp;rsquo;s lost! I take back the coat
      and watch&amp;mdash;what says Ahab? We must save that boy.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s drowned with the rest on &amp;rsquo;em, last night,&amp;rdquo; said the old Manx sailor
      standing behind them; &amp;ldquo;I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel&amp;rsquo;s the
      more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
      Captain&amp;rsquo;s sons among the number of the missing boat&amp;rsquo;s crew; but among the
      number of the other boat&amp;rsquo;s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand,
      separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there
      had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was
      plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved
      for him by his chief mate&amp;rsquo;s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure
      of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between
      jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But
      the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
      mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab&amp;rsquo;s iciness did he
      allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,
      whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer&amp;rsquo;s
      paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and
      wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor
      does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of
      such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years&amp;rsquo; 
      voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of
      a whaleman&amp;rsquo;s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
      father&amp;rsquo;s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
      concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and
      Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the
      least quivering of his own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I will not go,&amp;rdquo; said the stranger, &amp;ldquo;till you say &lt;i&gt;aye&lt;/i&gt; to me. Do to me as
      you would have me do to you in the like case. For &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; too have a boy,
      Captain Ahab&amp;mdash;though but a child, and nestling safely at home now&amp;mdash;a
      child of your old age too&amp;mdash;Yes, yes, you relent; I see it&amp;mdash;run,
      run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Avast,&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;touch not a rope-yarn&amp;rdquo;; then in a voice that
      prolongingly moulded every word&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
      Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
      forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
      and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:
      then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving
      the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection
      of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner
      silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and
      returned to his ship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
      was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
      however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
      starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head
      sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and
      yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when
      the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
      that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
      She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.

    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming
      when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him.
      There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady.
      Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired
      health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou
      wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair;
      another screw to it, thou must be.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for your
      one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part
      of ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
      fidelity of man!&amp;mdash;and a black! and crazy!&amp;mdash;but methinks
      like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
      drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
      But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
      ye.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s purpose keels up in him. I
      tell thee no; it cannot be.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh good master, master, master!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
      Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
      know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!&amp;mdash;Met! True art
      thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
      thee; and if it come to that,&amp;mdash;God for ever save thee, let what will
      befall.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      (&lt;i&gt;Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.&lt;/i&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,&amp;mdash;but I&amp;rsquo;m alone. Now
      were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he&amp;rsquo;s missing. Pip! Pip!
      Ding, dong, ding! Who&amp;rsquo;s seen Pip? He must be up here; let&amp;rsquo;s try the door.
      What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there&amp;rsquo;s no opening it. It
      must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed
      chair was mine. Here, then, I&amp;rsquo;ll seat me, against the transom, in the
      ship&amp;rsquo;s full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our
      old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit
      at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what&amp;rsquo;s
      this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the
      decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now,
      when a black boy&amp;rsquo;s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!&amp;mdash;Monsieurs,
      have ye seen one Pip?&amp;mdash;a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog
      look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;&amp;mdash;seen him? No!
      Well then, fill up again, captains, and let&amp;rsquo;s drink shame upon all
      cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table.
      Shame upon all cowards.&amp;mdash;Hist! above there, I hear ivory&amp;mdash;Oh,
      master! master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here
      I&amp;rsquo;ll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and
      oysters come to join me.&amp;rdquo;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
      preliminary cruise, Ahab,&amp;mdash;all other whaling waters swept&amp;mdash;seemed
      to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
      there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
      where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been
      spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;&amp;mdash;and
      now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly
      concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale
      tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there
      lurked a something in the old man&amp;rsquo;s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable
      for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through the
      livelong, arctic, six months&amp;rsquo; night sustains its piercing, steady, central
      gaze; so Ahab&amp;rsquo;s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant
      midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their
      bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls,
      and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
      vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove
      to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
      finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s
      iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious
      that the old man&amp;rsquo;s despot eye was on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he
      thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even
      as Ahab&amp;rsquo;s eyes so awed the crew&amp;rsquo;s, the inscrutable Parsee&amp;rsquo;s glance awed
      his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an
      added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such
      ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half
      uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or
      else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being&amp;rsquo;s body.
      And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had
      Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. He would stand
      still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
      plainly say&amp;mdash;We two watchmen never rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
      deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or
      exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,&amp;mdash;the
      main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
      cabin-scuttle,&amp;mdash;his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to
      step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless
      he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
      in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
      tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
      times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though
      he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the
      unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat
      and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day&amp;rsquo;s sunshine dried
      upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more
      beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent
      for.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,&amp;mdash;breakfast
      and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
      grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow
      idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though
      his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee&amp;rsquo;s
      mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never
      seemed to speak&amp;mdash;one man to the other&amp;mdash;unless at long intervals
      some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
      spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
      crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one
      word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest
      verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail,
      they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by
      the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
      Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned
      substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And yet, somehow, did Ahab&amp;mdash;in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
      and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,&amp;mdash;Ahab
      seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
      seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade
      siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was
      solid Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
      from aft,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Man the mast-heads!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and all through the day, till
      after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the
      striking of the helmsman&amp;rsquo;s bell, was heard&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;What d&amp;rsquo;ye see?&amp;mdash;sharp!
      sharp!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
      children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
      old man seemed distrustful of his crew&amp;rsquo;s fidelity; at least, of nearly all
      except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and
      Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these
      suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
      expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I will have the first sight of the whale myself,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he said. &amp;ldquo;Aye!
      Ahab must have the doubloon!&amp;rdquo; and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
      basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block,
      to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
      downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
      the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end
      yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his
      crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo,
      Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm
      relying eye upon the chief mate, said,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Take the rope, sir&amp;mdash;I
      give it into thy hands, Starbuck.&amp;rdquo; Then arranging his person in the
      basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck
      being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.
      And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad
      upon the sea for miles and miles,&amp;mdash;ahead, astern, this side, and
      that,&amp;mdash;within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a
      height.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the
      rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted
      up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
      circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
      to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a
      wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft
      cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck;
      and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast
      down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
      unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
      carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.
      So Ahab&amp;rsquo;s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange
      thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
      had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
      approaching to decision&amp;mdash;one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
      look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;&amp;mdash;it was strange, that this
      was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
      whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person&amp;rsquo;s hands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
      minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
      incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
      latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
      in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
      straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying
      again round his head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not
      to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it
      much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful
      eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Your hat, your hat, sir!&amp;rdquo; suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being
      posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat
      lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But already the sable wing was before the old man&amp;rsquo;s eyes; the long hooked
      bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his
      prize.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin&amp;rsquo;s head, removing his cap to replace it,
      and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of
      Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.
      Ahab&amp;rsquo;s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far
      in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of
      that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from
      that vast height into the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
      life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
      misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed
      upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross
      the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the
      spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Upon the stranger&amp;rsquo;s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some
      few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw
      through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
      half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Look!&amp;rdquo; replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his
      trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Hast killed him?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,&amp;rdquo; answered the
      other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
      sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not forged!&amp;rdquo; and snatching Perth&amp;rsquo;s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
      held it out, exclaiming&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I
      hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
      barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,
      where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Then God keep thee, old man&amp;mdash;see&amp;rsquo;st thou that&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;pointing to the
      hammock&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
      yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one I bury; the rest were
      buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.&amp;rdquo; Then turning to his
      crew&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift
      the body; so, then&amp;mdash;Oh! God&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;advancing towards the hammock with
      uplifted hands&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;may the resurrection and the life&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Brace forward! Up helm!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
      of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
      quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
      her hull with their ghostly baptism.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
      hanging at the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s stern came into conspicuous relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!&amp;rdquo; cried a foreboding voice in her wake. &amp;ldquo;In
      vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
      taffrail to show us your coffin!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly
      separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
      transparently pure and soft, with a woman&amp;rsquo;s look, and the robust and
      man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson&amp;rsquo;s chest
      in his sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
      unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but
      to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty
      leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled,
      murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
      shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
      that distinguished them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air
      to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling
      line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&amp;mdash;most seen here at
      the equator&amp;mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms,
      with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and
      unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of
      ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting
      his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl&amp;rsquo;s forehead of heaven.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
      creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
      oblivious were ye of old Ahab&amp;rsquo;s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
      little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
      their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the
      marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
      watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
      and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
      aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the
      cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did
      at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&amp;mdash;forbidding&amp;mdash;now
      threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously
      sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could
      yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched
      hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
      wealth as that one wee drop.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
      and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
      stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him,
      or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab turned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Starbuck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a
      day&amp;mdash;very much such a sweetness as this&amp;mdash;I struck my first whale&amp;mdash;a
      boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty&amp;mdash;forty&amp;mdash;forty years ago!&amp;mdash;ago!
      Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
      storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
      forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of
      the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent
      three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of
      solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain&amp;rsquo;s
      exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
      green country without&amp;mdash;oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery
      of solitary command!&amp;mdash;when I think of all this; only half-suspected,
      not so keenly known to me before&amp;mdash;and how for forty years I have fed
      upon dry salted fare&amp;mdash;fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!&amp;mdash;when
      the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
      world&amp;rsquo;s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts&amp;mdash;away, whole oceans away,
      from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
      the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow&amp;mdash;wife? wife?&amp;mdash;rather
      a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I
      married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling
      blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab
      has furiously, foamingly chased his prey&amp;mdash;more a demon than a man!&amp;mdash;aye,
      aye! what a forty years&amp;rsquo; fool&amp;mdash;fool&amp;mdash;old fool, has old Ahab
      been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the
      oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?
      Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,
      one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old
      hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never
      grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old,
      Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam,
      staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!&amp;mdash;crack
      my heart!&amp;mdash;stave my brain!&amp;mdash;mockery! mockery! bitter, biting
      mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and
      feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look
      into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than
      to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
      the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
      stay on board, on board!&amp;mdash;lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
      gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
      the far away home I see in that eye!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
      should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly
      these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;wife
      and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine,
      sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!
      Away! let us away!&amp;mdash;this instant let me alter the course! How
      cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see
      old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days,
      even as this, in Nantucket.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;They have, they have. I have seen them&amp;mdash;some summer days in the
      morning. About this time&amp;mdash;yes, it is his noon nap now&amp;mdash;the boy
      vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
      cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to
      dance him again.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
      should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father&amp;rsquo;s
      sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
      Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy&amp;rsquo;s face
      from the window! the boy&amp;rsquo;s hand on the hill!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Ahab&amp;rsquo;s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
      cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
      cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands
      me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and
      crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready
      to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare?
      Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great
      sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single
      star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small
      heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that
      beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man,
      we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and
      Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
      unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and
      fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who&amp;rsquo;s to doom, when the
      judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a
      mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away
      meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes,
      Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?
      Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye,
      and rust amid greenness; as last year&amp;rsquo;s scythes flung down, and left in
      the half-cut swaths&amp;mdash;Starbuck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But blanched to a corpse&amp;rsquo;s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two
      reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
      leaning over the same rail.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 133. The Chase&amp;mdash;First Day.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man&amp;mdash;as his wont at
      intervals&amp;mdash;stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
      went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
      up the sea air as a sagacious ship&amp;rsquo;s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
      barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar
      odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale,
      was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after
      inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the
      precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered
      the ship&amp;rsquo;s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at
      daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise
      ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles
      bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at
      the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
      deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed
      to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their
      clothes in their hands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What d&amp;rsquo;ye see?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nothing, nothing sir!&amp;rdquo; was the sound hailing down in reply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rsquo;gallant sails!&amp;mdash;stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying
      him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting
      him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while
      peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and
      top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air. &amp;ldquo;There she blows!&amp;mdash;there
      she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
      look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
      whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch,
      some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on
      the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian&amp;rsquo;s head was almost on a
      level with Ahab&amp;rsquo;s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile
      or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,
      and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous
      mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in
      the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And did none of ye see it before?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
      all around him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
      cried out,&amp;rdquo; said Tashtego.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Not the same instant; not the same&amp;mdash;no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
      reserved the doubloon for me. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; only; none of ye could have raised the
      White Whale first. There she blows!&amp;mdash;there she blows!&amp;mdash;there she
      blows! There again!&amp;mdash;there again!&amp;rdquo; he cried, in long-drawn,
      lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
      whale&amp;rsquo;s visible jets. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
      top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on
      board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,
      steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats
      there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,&amp;mdash;quick,
      quicker!&amp;rdquo; and he slid through the air to the deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;He is heading straight to leeward, sir,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;right away from
      us; cannot have seen the ship yet.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!&amp;mdash;brace up!
      Shiver her!&amp;mdash;shiver her!&amp;mdash;So; well that! Boats, boats!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Soon all the boats but Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s were dropped; all the boat-sails set&amp;mdash;all
      the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
      heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah&amp;rsquo;s sunken eyes; a
      hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
      but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
      still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
      noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came
      so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was
      distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and
      continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He
      saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.
      Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening
      white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully
      accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed
      over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
      bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the
      light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate
      with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the
      painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance
      projected from the white whale&amp;rsquo;s back; and at intervals one of the cloud
      of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
      the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers
      streaming like pennons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A gentle joyousness&amp;mdash;a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
      invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
      ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes
      sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling
      straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty
      Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      On each soft side&amp;mdash;coincident with the parted swell, that but once
      leaving him, then flowed so wide away&amp;mdash;on each bright side, the whale
      shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
      namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to
      assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
      tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who
      for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou
      may&amp;rsquo;st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
      waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick
      moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged
      trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the
      fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole
      marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Natural Bridge, and
      warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed
      himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping
      on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool
      that he left.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
      three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick&amp;rsquo;s reappearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;An hour,&amp;rdquo; said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat&amp;rsquo;s stern; and he gazed
      beyond the whale&amp;rsquo;s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
      vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
      whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now
      freshened; the sea began to swell.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The birds!&amp;mdash;the birds!&amp;rdquo; cried Tashtego.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
      all flying towards Ahab&amp;rsquo;s boat; and when within a few yards began
      fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
      expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man&amp;rsquo;s; Ahab could discover
      no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its
      depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
      weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till
      it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of
      white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It
      was Moby Dick&amp;rsquo;s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still
      half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned
      beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong
      sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this
      tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with
      him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth&amp;rsquo;s harpoon, commanded his
      crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its
      bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale&amp;rsquo;s head while yet under
      water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious
      intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were,
      in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an
      instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting
      shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that
      the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and
      one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the
      inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s head, and reached higher
      than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as
      a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and
      crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each
      other&amp;rsquo;s heads to gain the uttermost stern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
      whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
      body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the
      bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the
      other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to
      withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing
      vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very
      jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his
      naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus
      vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in,
      collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding
      further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast
      again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated
      aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to
      the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to
      perceive the whale&amp;rsquo;s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
      movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
      made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping
      further into the whale&amp;rsquo;s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped,
      the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he
      leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
      distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
      billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so
      that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose&amp;mdash;some twenty or more feet
      out of the water&amp;mdash;the now rising swells, with all their confluent
      waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered
      spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled
      Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly
      to overleap its summit with their scud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation
      (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise
      of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously
      described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
      view whatever objects may be encircling him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.
      The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of
      grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus&amp;rsquo;s elephants in the book of
      Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale&amp;rsquo;s
      insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,&amp;mdash;though he could
      still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless
      Ahab&amp;rsquo;s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
      might burst. From the boat&amp;rsquo;s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and
      mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
      succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so
      revolvingly appalling was the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s aspect, and so planetarily
      swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally
      swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered
      hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that
      should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized
      castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to
      escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the
      direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man&amp;rsquo;s head.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and
      was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Sail on the&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but
      that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him
      for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a
      towering crest, he shouted,&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Sail on the whale!&amp;mdash;Drive him
      off!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Pequod&amp;rsquo;s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
      effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam
      off, the boats flew to the rescue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dragged into Stubb&amp;rsquo;s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
      caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s bodily strength did
      crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body&amp;rsquo;s doom: for a time, lying all
      crushed in the bottom of Stubb&amp;rsquo;s boat, like one trodden under foot of
      herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate
      sounds from out ravines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
      abbreviate it. In an instant&amp;rsquo;s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to
      one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
      through feebler men&amp;rsquo;s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in
      each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
      aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities;
      for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the
      entire circumferences of inferior souls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The harpoon,&amp;rdquo; said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one
      bended arm&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;is it safe?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb, showing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lay it before me;&amp;mdash;any missing men?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;One, two, three, four, five;&amp;mdash;there were five oars, sir, and here
      are five men.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s good.&amp;mdash;Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!
      there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!&amp;mdash;Hands
      off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s bones again! Set the sail;
      out oars; the helm!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up
      by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus
      continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the
      added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he
      seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which
      plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the
      chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor
      could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense
      straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
      vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the
      most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly,
      the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes&amp;mdash;the
      two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her&amp;mdash;and
      then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and
      sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings
      of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
      the well known, methodic intervals, the whale&amp;rsquo;s glittering spout was
      regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
      reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
      deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted
      hour expired, his voice was heard.&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Whose is the doubloon now? D&amp;rsquo;ye
      see him?&amp;rdquo; and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to
      lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and
      motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
      or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
      greater breadth&amp;mdash;thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
      every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the
      quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At
      last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
      troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man&amp;rsquo;s face
      there now stole some such added gloom as this.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince
      his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his
      Captain&amp;rsquo;s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;The
      thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I
      not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear
      thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir,&amp;rdquo; said Starbuck drawing near, &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;tis a solemn sight; an omen, and
      an ill one.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Omen? omen?&amp;mdash;the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
      man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give
      an old wives&amp;rsquo; darkling hint.&amp;mdash;Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
      of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
      two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
      peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold&amp;mdash;I shiver!&amp;mdash;How
      now? Aloft there! D&amp;rsquo;ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout
      ten times a second!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
      Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t see the spout now, sir;&amp;mdash;too dark&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;cried a voice from
      the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;How heading when last seen?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;As before, sir,&amp;mdash;straight to leeward.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Good! he will travel slower now &amp;rsquo;tis night. Down royals and top-gallant
      stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he&amp;rsquo;s
      making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full
      before the wind!&amp;mdash;Aloft! come down!&amp;mdash;Mr. Stubb, send a fresh
      hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Then
      advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Men, this gold is
      mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale
      is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall
      be killed, this gold is that man&amp;rsquo;s; and if on that day I shall again raise
      him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!&amp;mdash;the
      deck is thine, sir!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
      slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing
      himself to see how the night wore on.

      CHAPTER 134. The Chase&amp;mdash;Second Day.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rsquo;ye see him?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to
      spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;See nothing, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;&amp;mdash;the
      top-gallant sails!&amp;mdash;aye, they should have been kept on her all night.
      But no matter&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;tis but resting for the rush.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
      continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
      by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,
      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the
      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a
      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly
      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,
      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through
      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the
      creature&amp;rsquo;s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to
      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot&amp;rsquo;s coast is to him. So that
      to this hunter&amp;rsquo;s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing
      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as
      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby&amp;rsquo;s pulse; and lightly
      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,
      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence
      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this
      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at
      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman&amp;rsquo;s
      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is
      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a
      quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many
      collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,
      missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;By salt and hemp!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;but this swift motion of the deck creeps
      up one&amp;rsquo;s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave
      fellows!&amp;mdash;Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on
      the sea,&amp;mdash;for by live-oaks! my spine&amp;rsquo;s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
      that leaves no dust behind!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There she blows&amp;mdash;she blows!&amp;mdash;she blows!&amp;mdash;right ahead!&amp;rdquo; was
      now the mast-head cry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb, &amp;ldquo;I knew it&amp;mdash;ye can&amp;rsquo;t escape&amp;mdash;blow on
      and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
      your trump&amp;mdash;blister your lungs!&amp;mdash;Ahab will dam off your blood,
      as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of
      the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked
      anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt
      before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe
      of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid
      prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had
      snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day;
      the rack of the past night&amp;rsquo;s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind,
      reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying
      mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that
      made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms
      invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency
      which so enslaved them to the race.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
      though it was put together of all contrasting things&amp;mdash;oak, and maple,
      and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp&amp;mdash;yet all these ran into each
      other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
      directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the
      crew, this man&amp;rsquo;s valor, that man&amp;rsquo;s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all
      varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
      goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
      outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
      hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading
      their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all
      the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!
      how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing
      that might destroy them!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, when, after the
      lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. &amp;ldquo;Sway
      me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that
      way, and then disappears.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
      other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
      hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin
      on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air
      vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo
      of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as&amp;mdash;much nearer to the ship than
      the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead&amp;mdash;Moby Dick
      bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by
      the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
      Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of
      breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the
      Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and
      piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of
      seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
      off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;There she breaches! there she breaches!&amp;rdquo; was the cry, as in his
      immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
      Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
      against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
      the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood
      there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,
      to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, &amp;ldquo;thy hour and
      thy harpoon are at hand!&amp;mdash;Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
      fore. The boats!&amp;mdash;stand by!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
      shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards;
      while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lower away,&amp;rdquo; he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat&amp;mdash;a spare
      one, rigged the afternoon previous. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine&amp;mdash;keep
      away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
      assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three
      crews. Ahab&amp;rsquo;s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he
      would take the whale head-and-head,&amp;mdash;that is, pull straight up to his
      forehead,&amp;mdash;a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
      such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale&amp;rsquo;s sidelong vision.
      But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
      plain as the ship&amp;rsquo;s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
      himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among
      the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on
      every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
      seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those
      boats were made. But skilfully manÅuvred, incessantly wheeling like
      trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,
      at times, but by a plank&amp;rsquo;s breadth; while all the time, Ahab&amp;rsquo;s unearthly
      slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and
      recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines
      now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the
      devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment
      the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous
      charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then
      was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again&amp;mdash;hoping that way to
      disencumber it of some snarls&amp;mdash;when lo!&amp;mdash;a sight more savage
      than the embattled teeth of sharks!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Caught and twisted&amp;mdash;corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
      harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
      flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s boat. Only
      one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
      within&amp;mdash;through&amp;mdash;and then, without&amp;mdash;the rays of steel;
      dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,
      twice sundering the rope near the chocks&amp;mdash;dropped the intercepted
      fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
      White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
      lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb
      and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks
      on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
      a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the
      wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred
      bowl of punch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
      the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope
      little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs
      upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
      singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man&amp;rsquo;s line&amp;mdash;now
      parting&amp;mdash;admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom
      he could;&amp;mdash;in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted
      perils,&amp;mdash;Ahab&amp;rsquo;s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by
      invisible wires,&amp;mdash;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the
      sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and
      sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again&amp;mdash;gunwale
      downwards&amp;mdash;and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like
      seals from a sea-side cave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The first uprising momentum of the whale&amp;mdash;modifying its direction as
      he struck the surface&amp;mdash;involuntarily launched him along it, to a
      little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with
      his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes
      from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
      or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
      came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for
      that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and
      trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a
      traveller&amp;rsquo;s methodic pace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came
      bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating
      mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely
      landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;
      livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies
      of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or
      even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day
      before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat&amp;rsquo;s broken half,
      which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as
      the previous day&amp;rsquo;s mishap.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
      instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
      Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg
      had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, Starbuck, &amp;rsquo;tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
      will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The ferrule has not stood, sir,&amp;rdquo; said the carpenter, now coming up; &amp;ldquo;I
      put good work into that leg.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But no bones broken, sir, I hope,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb with true concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!&amp;mdash;d&amp;rsquo;ye see it.&amp;mdash;But
      even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
      bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that&amp;rsquo;s lost. Nor white
      whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper
      and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
      yonder roof?&amp;mdash;Aloft there! which way?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Dead to leeward, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the
      spare boats and rig them&amp;mdash;Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat&amp;rsquo;s
      crews.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
      unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane&amp;mdash;there, that
      shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By
      heaven it cannot be!&amp;mdash;missing?&amp;mdash;quick! call them all.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The old man&amp;rsquo;s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
      Parsee was not there.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The Parsee!&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;he must have been caught in&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The black vomit wrench thee!&amp;mdash;run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
      forecastle&amp;mdash;find him&amp;mdash;not gone&amp;mdash;not gone!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
      nowhere to be found.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir,&amp;rdquo; said Stubb&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;caught among the tangles of your line&amp;mdash;I
      thought I saw him dragging under.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; line! &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; line? Gone?&amp;mdash;gone? What means that little word?&amp;mdash;What
      death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
      The harpoon, too!&amp;mdash;toss over the litter there,&amp;mdash;d&amp;rsquo;ye see it?&amp;mdash;the
      forged iron, men, the white whale&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;no, no, no,&amp;mdash;blistered
      fool! this hand did dart it!&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;tis in the fish!&amp;mdash;Aloft there!
      Keep him nailed&amp;mdash;Quick!&amp;mdash;all hands to the rigging of the boats&amp;mdash;collect
      the oars&amp;mdash;harpooneers! the irons, the irons!&amp;mdash;hoist the royals
      higher&amp;mdash;a pull on all the sheets!&amp;mdash;helm there! steady, steady
      for your life! I&amp;rsquo;ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive
      straight through it, but I&amp;rsquo;ll slay him yet!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck;
      &amp;ldquo;never, never wilt thou capture him, old man&amp;mdash;In Jesus&amp;rsquo; name no more
      of this, that&amp;rsquo;s worse than devil&amp;rsquo;s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
      to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
      shadow gone&amp;mdash;all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:&amp;mdash;what more
      wouldst thou have?&amp;mdash;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps
      the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be
      towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,&amp;mdash;Impiety and blasphemy to hunt
      him more!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Starbuck, of late I&amp;rsquo;ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour
      we both saw&amp;mdash;thou know&amp;rsquo;st what, in one another&amp;rsquo;s eyes. But in this
      matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
      hand&amp;mdash;a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
      whole act&amp;rsquo;s immutably decreed. &amp;rsquo;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
      years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates&amp;rsquo; lieutenant; I act
      under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&amp;mdash;Stand
      round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a
      shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. &amp;rsquo;Tis Ahab&amp;mdash;his body&amp;rsquo;s
      part; but Ahab&amp;rsquo;s soul&amp;rsquo;s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I
      feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
      gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye&amp;rsquo;ll hear me crack; and till ye
      hear &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, know that Ahab&amp;rsquo;s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men,
      in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they
      drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
      sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick&amp;mdash;two days he&amp;rsquo;s floated&amp;mdash;tomorrow
      will be the third. Aye, men, he&amp;rsquo;ll rise once more,&amp;mdash;but only to spout
      his last! D&amp;rsquo;ye feel brave men, brave?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;As fearless fire,&amp;rdquo; cried Stubb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;And as mechanical,&amp;rdquo; muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
      muttered on: &amp;ldquo;The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to
      Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to
      drive out of others&amp;rsquo; hearts what&amp;rsquo;s clinched so fast in mine!&amp;mdash;The
      Parsee&amp;mdash;the Parsee!&amp;mdash;gone, gone? and he was to go before:&amp;mdash;but
      still was to be seen again ere I could perish&amp;mdash;How&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;mdash;There&amp;rsquo;s
      a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the
      whole line of judges:&amp;mdash;like a hawk&amp;rsquo;s beak it pecks my brain. &lt;i&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;/i&gt;,
      &lt;i&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;/i&gt; solve it, though!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
      the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
      grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
      in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
      their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s
      wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the
      night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid,
      heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
      eastward for the earliest sun.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a name=&#34;link2HCH0135&#34; id=&#34;link2HCH0135&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      CHAPTER 135. The Chase.&amp;mdash;Third Day.
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
      solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
      daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rsquo;ye see him?&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that&amp;rsquo;s all. Helm
      there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer
      day could not dawn upon that world. Here&amp;rsquo;s food for thought, had Ahab time
      to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; &lt;i&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/i&gt;
      tingling enough for mortal man! to think&amp;rsquo;s audacity. God only has that
      right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
      calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
      that. And yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm&amp;mdash;frozen
      calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned
      to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment
      growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it&amp;rsquo;s like that sort of common
      grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice
      or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as
      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile
      wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,
      and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither
      as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s tainted. Were I the wind,
      I&amp;rsquo;d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I&amp;rsquo;d crawl somewhere to
      a cave, and slink there. And yet, &amp;rsquo;tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!
      who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.
      Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even
      Ahab is a braver thing&amp;mdash;a nobler thing than &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. Would now the wind
      but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal
      man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as
      agents. There&amp;rsquo;s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious
      difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there&amp;rsquo;s something
      all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least,
      that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,
      vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser
      currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the
      land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the
      eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;
      these Trades, or something like them&amp;mdash;something so unchangeable, and
      full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d&amp;rsquo;ye
      see?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nothing, sir.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye,
      aye, it must be so. I&amp;rsquo;ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he&amp;rsquo;s
      chasing &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; now; not I, &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s bad; I might have known it, too.
      Fool! the lines&amp;mdash;the harpoons he&amp;rsquo;s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
      by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
      outs! Man the braces!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s
      quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
      ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
      white wake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,&amp;rdquo; murmured Starbuck to
      himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. &amp;ldquo;God keep
      us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my
      flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stand by to sway me up!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. &amp;ldquo;We
      should meet him soon.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&amp;rdquo; and straightway Starbuck did Ahab&amp;rsquo;s bidding, and once
      more Ahab swung on high.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
      long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
      weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
      mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
      there!&amp;mdash;brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind&amp;rsquo;s eye. He&amp;rsquo;s too far
      off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman
      with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have
      one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there&amp;rsquo;s time for that. An
      old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink
      since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!&amp;mdash;the
      same!&amp;mdash;the same to Noah as to me. There&amp;rsquo;s a soft shower to leeward.
      Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere&amp;mdash;to something else
      than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes
      that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But
      good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;mdash;green? aye, tiny
      mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab&amp;rsquo;s
      head! There&amp;rsquo;s the difference now between man&amp;rsquo;s old age and matter&amp;rsquo;s. But
      aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are
      we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that&amp;rsquo;s all. By heaven this dead wood
      has the better of my live flesh every way. I can&amp;rsquo;t compare with it; and
      I&amp;rsquo;ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of
      the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What&amp;rsquo;s that he said? he should
      still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I
      have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless
      stairs? and all night I&amp;rsquo;ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.
      Aye, aye, like many more thou told&amp;rsquo;st direful truth as touching thyself, O
      Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head&amp;mdash;keep
      a good eye upon the whale, the while I&amp;rsquo;m gone. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk to-morrow, nay,
      to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through
      the cloven blue air to the deck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop&amp;rsquo;s
      stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
      mate,&amp;mdash;who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck&amp;mdash;and bade him
      pause.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Starbuck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Sir?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;For the third time my soul&amp;rsquo;s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
      Starbuck!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Truth, sir: saddest truth.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
      flood;&amp;mdash;and I feel now like a billow that&amp;rsquo;s all one crested comb,
      Starbuck. I am old;&amp;mdash;shake hands with me, man.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s tears the glue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh, my captain, my captain!&amp;mdash;noble heart&amp;mdash;go not&amp;mdash;go not!&amp;mdash;see,
      it&amp;rsquo;s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Lower away!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;cried Ahab, tossing the mate&amp;rsquo;s arm from him. &amp;ldquo;Stand by
      the crew!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The sharks! the sharks!&amp;rdquo; cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
      &amp;ldquo;O master, my master, come back!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
      boat leaped on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
      numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the
      hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
      dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
      bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those
      swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same
      prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments
      in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the
      Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was
      that Ahab&amp;rsquo;s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore
      their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks&amp;mdash;a matter
      sometimes well known to affect them,&amp;mdash;however it was, they seemed to
      follow that one boat without molesting the others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Heart of wrought steel!&amp;rdquo; murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
      following with his eyes the receding boat&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;canst thou yet ring
      boldly to that sight?&amp;mdash;lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
      followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third
      day?&amp;mdash;For when three days flow together in one continuous intense
      pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the
      third the evening and the end of that thing&amp;mdash;be that end what it may.
      Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly
      calm, yet expectant,&amp;mdash;fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things
      swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is
      somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!
      I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life
      seem clearing; but clouds sweep between&amp;mdash;Is my journey&amp;rsquo;s end coming?
      My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,&amp;mdash;beats
      it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!&amp;mdash;stave it off&amp;mdash;move, move! speak
      aloud!&amp;mdash;Mast-head there! See ye my boy&amp;rsquo;s hand on the hill?&amp;mdash;Crazed;&amp;mdash;aloft
      there!&amp;mdash;keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:&amp;mdash;mark well the
      whale!&amp;mdash;Ho! again!&amp;mdash;drive off that hawk! see! he pecks&amp;mdash;he tears
      the vane&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;pointing to the red flag flying at the
      main-truck&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Ha! he soars away with it!&amp;mdash;Where&amp;rsquo;s the old man
      now? see&amp;rsquo;st thou that sight, oh Ahab!&amp;mdash;shudder, shudder!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads&amp;mdash;a
      downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending
      to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways
      from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence,
      as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive
      them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse
      can be mine:&amp;mdash;and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
      quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
      swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
      subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
      trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but
      obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
      hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back
      into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an
      instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,
      leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk
      of the whale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Give way!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the
      attack; but maddened by yesterday&amp;rsquo;s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby
      Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.
      The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead,
      beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came
      churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart;
      spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates&amp;rsquo; boats, and dashing
      in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab&amp;rsquo;s almost
      without a scar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
      whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
      shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and
      round to the fish&amp;rsquo;s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
      during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
      around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
      frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The harpoon dropped from his hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Befooled, befooled!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;drawing in a long lean breath&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Aye,
      Parsee! I see thee again.&amp;mdash;Aye, and thou goest before; and this, &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;
      then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last
      letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship!
      those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to
      me; if not, Ahab is enough to die&amp;mdash;Down, men! the first thing that
      but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
      not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.&amp;mdash;Where&amp;rsquo;s the
      whale? gone down again?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
      corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
      been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
      swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,&amp;mdash;which thus far had
      been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her
      headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and
      now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oh! Ahab,&amp;rdquo; cried Starbuck, &amp;ldquo;not too late is it, even now, the third day,
      to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly
      seekest him!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
      leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the
      vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck&amp;rsquo;s face as he leaned
      over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not
      too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego,
      Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the
      oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been
      hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after
      the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying
      glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of
      new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the
      broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But
      he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
      main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to
      descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to
      the mast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Whether fagged by the three days&amp;rsquo; running chase, and the resistance to his
      swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent
      deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s way
      now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him
      once more; though indeed the whale&amp;rsquo;s last start had not been so long a one
      as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks
      accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so
      continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and
      crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!
      &amp;rsquo;tis the better rest, the shark&amp;rsquo;s jaw than the yielding water.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;They will last long enough! pull on!&amp;mdash;But who can tell&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he
      muttered&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
      Ahab?&amp;mdash;But pull on! Aye, all alive, now&amp;mdash;we near him. The helm!
      take the helm! let me pass,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
      him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
      the White Whale&amp;rsquo;s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance&amp;mdash;as
      the whale sometimes will&amp;mdash;and Ahab was fairly within the smoky
      mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale&amp;rsquo;s spout, curled round his
      great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body
      arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted
      his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both
      steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick
      sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow,
      and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that
      had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then
      clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was,
      three of the oarsmen&amp;mdash;who foreknew not the precise instant of the
      dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects&amp;mdash;these were flung
      out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale
      again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
      inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat
      and swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
      instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea.
      But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line,
      and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and
      tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that
      double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;tis whole again; oars! oars!
      Burst in upon him!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
      round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
      catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in
      it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it&amp;mdash;it may be&amp;mdash;a
      larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow,
      smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. &amp;ldquo;I grow blind; hands! stretch
      out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is&amp;rsquo;t night?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The whale! The ship!&amp;rdquo; cried the cringing oarsmen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever
      too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the
      ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
      sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
      burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay
      nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard
      to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego&amp;rsquo;s mast-head hammer
      remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
      with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
      forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
      bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as
      he.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
      now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman&amp;rsquo;s
      fainting fit. Up helm, I say&amp;mdash;ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the
      end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab,
      Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He
      turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose
      duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
      Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
      Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb&amp;rsquo;s own unwinking eye?
      And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would
      it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look
      ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever
      spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye,
      would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but
      there&amp;rsquo;ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off
      shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and
      over salted death, though;&amp;mdash;cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask,
      for one red cherry ere we die!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my
      poor mother&amp;rsquo;s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now
      come to her, for the voyage is up.&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      From the ship&amp;rsquo;s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
      bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands,
      just as they had darted from their various employments; all their
      enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
      vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading
      semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,
      eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man
      could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship&amp;rsquo;s
      starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
      faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on
      their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as
      mountain torrents down a flume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;The ship! The hearse!&amp;mdash;the second hearse!&amp;rdquo; cried Ahab from the boat;
      &amp;ldquo;its wood could only be American!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel;
      but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the
      other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s boat, where, for a time, he
      lay quiescent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.
      Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only
      god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,&amp;mdash;death-glorious
      ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond
      pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life!
      Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from
      all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
      foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I
      roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple
      with thee; from hell&amp;rsquo;s heart I stab at thee; for hate&amp;rsquo;s sake I spit my
      last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
      and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
      chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! &lt;i&gt;Thus&lt;/i&gt;, I give up the
      spear!&amp;rdquo;
     &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
      velocity the line ran through the grooves;&amp;mdash;ran foul. Ahab stooped to
      clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck,
      and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out
      of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy
      eye-splice in the rope&amp;rsquo;s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub,
      knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      For an instant, the tranced boat&amp;rsquo;s crew stood still; then turned. &amp;ldquo;The
      ship? Great God, where is the ship?&amp;rdquo; Soon they through dim, bewildering
      mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana;
      only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or
      fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
      still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric
      circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
      oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round
      and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of
      sight.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken
      head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar
      yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly
      undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they
      almost touched;&amp;mdash;at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered
      backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster
      and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had
      followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars,
      pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced
      to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood;
      and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage
      beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird
      of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards,
      and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his
      ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a
      living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
      surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
      shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a name=&#34;link2H_EPIL&#34; id=&#34;link2H_EPIL&#34;&gt;
      &lt;!--  H2 anchor --&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;height: 4em;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      Epilogue
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      &amp;ldquo;AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE&amp;rdquo; Job.
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The drama&amp;rsquo;s done. Why then here does any one step forth?&amp;mdash;Because one
      did survive the wreck.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      It so chanced, that after the Parsee&amp;rsquo;s disappearance, I was he whom the
      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab&amp;rsquo;s bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the
      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,
      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a
      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like
      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black
      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin
      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on
      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It
      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her
      missing children, only found another orphan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&amp;rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

        The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see
        him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
        handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
        known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
        somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
      
      
        “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name
        a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
        ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of
        the word, you deliver that which is not true.” —Hackluyt.
      
      
        “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval. This animal is named from roundness or
        rolling; for in Dan. hvalt is arched or vaulted.” —Webster’s
        Dictionary.
      
      
        “WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. Wallen; A.S.
        Walw-ian, to roll, to wallow.” —Richardson’s Dictionary.

        EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
      
      
        It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
        poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
        and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
        whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
        Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
        higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
        extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
        ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
        extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
        bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
        and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
        own.
      
      
        So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
        belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world
        will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;
        but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
        and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
        and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give
        it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
        world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
        could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
        your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
        friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
        and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
        against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there,
        ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!

        therein.” —Psalms.

        serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.” —Isaiah.
      
      
        “And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster’s
        mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that
        foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his
        paunch.” —Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals.
      
      
        “The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among
        which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in
        length as four acres or arpens of land.” —Holland’s Pliny.
      
      
        “Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
        great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the
        former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,
        open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before
        him into a foam.” —Tooke’s Lucian. “The True History.”
       
      
        “He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales,
        which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he brought
        some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own country, of
        which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was
        one of six who had killed sixty in two days.” —Other or Other’s
        verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King Alfred, A.D. 890.
      
      
        “And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter
        into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are
        immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in
        great security, and there sleeps.” —MONTAIGNE. —Apology for

     Like as the wounded whale to shore flies thro’ the maine.”

     “That sea beast
     Leviathan, which God of all his works
     Created hugest that swim the ocean stream.” —Paradise Lost.

     —-“There Leviathan,
     Hugest of living creatures, in the deep
     Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,
     And seems a moving land; and at his gills
     Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.” —Ibid.

        swimming in them.” —Fuller’s Profane and Holy State.

     The huge Leviathan to attend their prey,
     And give no chance, but swallow in the fry,
     Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way.”

        “While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off his
        head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come; but it
        will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.” —Thomas Edge’s
        Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas.
      
      
        “In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in
        wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which
        nature has placed on their shoulders.” —Sir T. Herbert’s Voyages
        into Asia and Africa. Harris Coll.
      
      
        “Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to

        upon them.” —Schouten’s Sixth Circumnavigation.
      
      
        “We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The
        Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that
        is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they
        can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains....
        I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of
        herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught
        once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.” —A Voyage to
        Greenland, A.D. 1671. Harris Coll.
      
      
        “Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one
        eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was
        informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of
        baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.”
         —Sibbald’s Fife and Kinross.
      
      
        “Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this
        Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that was
        killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.” —Richard

        “Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.” —N. E. Primer.
      
      
        “We saw also abundance of large whales, there being more in those
        southern seas, as I may say, by a hundred to one; than we have to the
        northward of us.” —Captain Cowley’s Voyage round the Globe, A.D.
        1729.

      —Rape of the Lock.

      
        “If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those that
        take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear
        contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest
        animal in creation.” —Goldsmith, Nat. Hist.
      
      
        “If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them
        speak like great whales.” —Goldsmith to Johnson.
      
      
        “In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was
        found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were then
        towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the
        whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.” —Cook’s Voyages.
      
      
        “The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so
        great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to
        mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and
        some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to
        terrify and prevent their too near approach.” —Uno Von Troil’s
        Letters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland in 1772.
      
      
        “The Spermacetti Whale found by the Nantuckois, is an active, fierce

        “A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on
        the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates
        and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which are whale and sturgeon.
        And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the coast, are the
        property of the king.” —Blackstone.

        “The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the
        water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage

     “In the free element beneath me swam,
     Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
     Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;
     Which language cannot paint, and mariner
     Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
     To insect millions peopling every wave:
     Gather’d in shoals immense, like floating islands,
     Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
     And trackless region, though on every side
     Assaulted by voracious enemies,
     Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or jaw,

        the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast
        swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of great
        astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting,
        and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm
        Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so
        little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent

      CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
    
    
      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
      shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
      the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
      circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
      it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
      involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
      of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
      upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
      from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
      people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
      as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
      flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
      There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
      in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
      towards the ocean with me.
    
    
      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
      as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf.
      Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
      the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
      breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
      crowds of water-gazers there.
    
    
      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
      you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
      over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as
      if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
      landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters,
      nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green
      fields gone? What do they here?
    
    
      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
      they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
      them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
      streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all
      unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
      of all those ships attract them thither?
    
    
      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
      and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let
      the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand
      that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead
      you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be
      athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
      happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one
      knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
    
    
      But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
      quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
      the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
      each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
      here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
      cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,
      reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
      But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes
      down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain,
      unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go
      visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
      knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there
      is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would
      you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
      Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
      whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a
      pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy
      with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to
      sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such
      a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
      of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the
      Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this
      is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
      Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he
      saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,
      we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
      ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
    
    
      Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to
      grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do
      not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to
      go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag
      unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow
      quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves
      much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though
      I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
      Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to
      those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable
      toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as
      much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,
      barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though
      I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of
      officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though
      once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,
      there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say
      reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous
      dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse,
      that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the
      pyramids.
    
    
      No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
      plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,
      they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like
      a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is
      unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor, particularly if you
      come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or
      Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting
      your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country
      schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition
      is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires
      a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear
      it. But even this wears off in time.
    
    
      What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
      mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
      Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
      respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t a
      slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me
      about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
      satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one
      way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
      metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed
      round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be
      content.
    
    
      Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying
      me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I
      ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there
      is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act
      of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two
      orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being paid,—what will compare
      with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
      marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root
      of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
      Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
    
    
      Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise
      and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are
      far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate
      the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the
      quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the
      forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
      way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same
      time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
      having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it
      into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
      of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs
      me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer
      than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed
      part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time
      ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
      extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
      something like this:
    
    
      “Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.
      “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”
     
    
      Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
      Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
      were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy
      parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot
      tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I
      think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being
      cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about
      performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it
      was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating
      judgment.
    
    
      Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
      himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
      Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the
      undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending
      marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to
      my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been
      inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for
      things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous
      coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and
      could still be social with it—would they let me—since it is
      but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one
      lodges in.
    
    
      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
      flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
      swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
      endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand
      hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
    
    
      I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
      and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old
      Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in
      December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for
      Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would
      offer, till the following Monday.
    
    
      As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
      this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be
      related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up
      to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine,
      boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old
      island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late
      been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this
      matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her
      great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
      first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did
      those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give
      chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
      adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
      cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
      order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
      bowsprit?
    
    
      Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in
      New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter
      of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very
      dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and
      cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded
      my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever
      you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary
      street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
      the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may
      conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the
      price, and don’t be too particular.
    
    
      With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
      Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
      Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there
      came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
      ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten
      inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
      when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,
      remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.
      Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the
      broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
      within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from
      before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I
      now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,
      doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.
    
    
      Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and
      here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this
      hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town
      proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding
      from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had
      a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so,
      entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the
      porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are
      these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But “The Crossed
      Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the sign
      of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
      within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.
    
    
      It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
      faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
      Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
      preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
      wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
      Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’ 
    
    
      Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
      and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging
      sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a
      tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The
      Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”
     
    
      Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
      thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose
      this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
      the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little
      wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the
      ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
      poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
      spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
    
    
      It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side
      palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak
      corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling
      than ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
      is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob
      quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called
      Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the only
      copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest
      out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or
      whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on
      both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.” True
      enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old
      black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this
      body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and
      the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s
      too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the
      copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor
      Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,
      and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both
      ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not
      keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his
      red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What
      a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them
      talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give
      me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
    
    
      But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to
      the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than
      here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of
      the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to
      keep out this frost?
    
    
      Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
      door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
      moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar
      in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
      temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
    
    
      But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
      plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,
      and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
    
    
      Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,
      straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the
      bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
      oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
      unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study
      and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the
      neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
      purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of
      much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
      might not be altogether unwarranted.
    
    
      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
      black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
      blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,
      soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
      Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity
      about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath
      with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and
      anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s
      the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the
      four primal elements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean
      winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.
      But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
      the picture’s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But
      stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the
      great leviathan himself?
    
    
      In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly
      based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I
      conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
      great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
      dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
      spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
      upon the three mast-heads.
    
    
      The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array
      of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth
      resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and
      one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment
      made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you
      gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have
      gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed
      with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and
      deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly
      elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
      sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was
      flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain
      off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like
      a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty
      feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
    
    
      Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
      through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
      fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier
      place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
      planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
      cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
      old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
      table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
      gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
      further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a
      rude attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
      vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
      beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
      bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another
      cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little
      withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
      and death.
    
    
      Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
      cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
      deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
      rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
      this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on
      to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for
      a shilling.
    
    
      Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a
      table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I sought
      the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,
      received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied.
      “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no objections to
      sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’,
      so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
     
    
      I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever
      do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he
      (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was
      not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a
      strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any
      decent man’s blanket.
    
    
      “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
      Supper’ll be ready directly.”
     
    
      I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
      Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
      his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
      between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he
      didn’t make much headway, I thought.
    
    
      At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining
      room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
      he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
      winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to
      our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare
      was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
      dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green
      box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
    
    
      “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
      sartainty.”
     
    
      “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
     
    
      “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the harpooneer
      is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he
      eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
     
    
      “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
     
    
      “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
    
    
      I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
      complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
      turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed
      before I did.
    
    
      Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what
      else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
      looker on.
    
    
      Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
      cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this
      morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll
      have the latest news from the Feegees.”
     
    
      A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
      and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy
      watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
      bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
      eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and
      this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a
      straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled
      little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
      round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed
      him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
      sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
      long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
      weather side of an ice-island.
    
    
      The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with
      the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about
      most obstreperously.
    
    
      I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
      seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
      sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as
      the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had
      ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a
      sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here
      venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in
      height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom
      seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his
      white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his
      eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
      His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine
      stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
      Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had
      mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more
      of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he
      was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge
      favourite with them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
      Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
    
    
      It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
      quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little
      plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
    
    
      No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
      rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but people
      like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping
      with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that
      stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was
      there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more
      than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than
      bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one
      apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own
      blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
    
    
      The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
      thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
      harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
      the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
      Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
      and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how
      could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
    
    
      “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t
      sleep with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
     
    
      “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
      mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots
      and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
      there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So
      saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first
      dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while
      grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
      plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near
      spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
      bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in
      the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
      shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the
      middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown
      study.
    
    
      I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
      short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
      narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than
      the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first
      bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a
      little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found
      that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of
      the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another
      current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both
      together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of
      the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
    
    
      The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal a
      march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
      wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
      second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
      morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
      standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
    
    
      Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a
      sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began to think that
      after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this
      unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in
      before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become
      jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
    
    
      But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
      and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
    
    
      “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep
      such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
    
    
      The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
      mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered,
      “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes,
      he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,
      you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be,
      he can’t sell his head.”
     
    
      “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
      are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
      landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
      night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
     
    
      “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t sell
      it here, the market’s overstocked.”
     
    
      “With what?” shouted I.
    
    
      “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
     
    
      “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better stop
      spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
     
    
      “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther
      guess you’ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’ 
      his head.”
     
    
      “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this
      unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
    
    
      “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
    
    
      “Broke,” said I—“broke, do you mean?”
     
    
      “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
     
    
      “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord,
      stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too
      without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can
      only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain
      harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you
      persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending
      to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design
      for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate
      and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak
      out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in
      all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you
      will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if
      true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and
      I’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, you I mean,
      landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
      thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
     
    
      “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
      sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
      this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the
      south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand heads (great
      curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s
      trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to
      be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches.
      He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin’ out of
      the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a
      string of inions.”
     
    
      This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
      that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at
      the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
      Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
      business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
    
    
      “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
     
    
      “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
      late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
      slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
      for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
      afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot
      of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,
      Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that,
      Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;”
       and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead
      the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he
      exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer to-night;
      he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; do come; won’t ye
      come?”
     
    
      I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
      ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
      with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
      to sleep abreast.
    
    
      “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
      that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
      yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
      eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
    
    
      Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
      most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced
      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no
      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,
      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not
      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown
      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the
      harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there
      was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
      fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
    
    
      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
      at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing
      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags
      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in
      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer
      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in
      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a
      hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as
      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I
      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw
      such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I
      gave myself a kink in the neck.
    
    
      I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
      head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half
      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the
      harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I
      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then
      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care
      of heaven.
    
    
      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there
      is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a
      long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly
      made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall
      in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under
      the door.
    
    
      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
      head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of
      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness
      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
      unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when,
      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,
      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking
      squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been
      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But
      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I
      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred
      to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who,
      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that
      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with
      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his
      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make
      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,
      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it
      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of
      a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the
      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
      thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
      hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh
      surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing
      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head
      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than
      ever I bolted a dinner.
    
    
      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it
      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance
      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded
      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was
      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to
      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed
      inexplicable in him.
    
    
      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his
      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with
      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark
      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped
      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were
      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of
      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage
      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in
      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps
      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens!
      look at that tomahawk!
    
    
      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a
      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old Congo baby.
      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black
      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that
      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished
      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed
      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and
      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,
      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks
      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
    
    
      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill
      at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top
      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a
      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and
      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be
      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;
      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it
      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry
      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics
      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who
      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or
      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,
      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a
      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
    
    
      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him
      now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and
      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before
      the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been
      bound.
    
    
      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an
      instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was
      extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang
      into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden
      grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
    
    
      Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against
      the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep
      quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural
      responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
    
    
      “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I
      kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in
      the dark.
    
    
      “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
      Coffin! Angels! save me!”
     
    
      “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
      cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot
      tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But
      thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in
      hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
    
    
      “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
      harm a hair of your head.”
     
    
      “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
      infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
     
    
      “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
      around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
      here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you
      sabbee?”
     
    
      “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
      sitting up in bed.
    
    
      “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing
      the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a
      really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all
      his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
      What’s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the
      man’s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,
      as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a
      drunken Christian.
    
    
      “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
      whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn
      in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It’s
      dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
     
    
      This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
      motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
      say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
     
    
      “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
     
    
      I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
    
    
      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought
      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little
      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all
      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of
      which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his
      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly
      rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I say, looked for
      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly
      lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from
      the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
      sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging
      me.
    
    
      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I
      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep
      do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all
      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my mother
      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though
      it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day
      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help
      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,
      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a
      bitter sigh got between the sheets.
    
    
      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of
      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in
      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the
      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at
      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,
      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,
      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my
      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an
      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of
      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay
      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,
      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen
      into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it—half
      steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was
      now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through
      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,
      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand
      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled
      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag
      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single
      inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness
      at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly
      remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost
      myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very
      hour, I often puzzle myself with it.
    
    
      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
      thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly
      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the
      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
      bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me
      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to
      rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then
      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly
      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the
      tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced
      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in
      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the
      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling,
      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all
      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff
      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of
      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I
      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon
      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed
      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it
      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain
      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would
      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is
      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate
      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially
      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he
      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of
      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette
      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways
      were well worth unusual regarding.
    
    
      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,
      by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
      movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under
      the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage—neither
      caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his
      outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not
      yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree
      civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at
      all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have
      dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with
      his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
      creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to
      boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to
      order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of
      a bitter cold morning.
    
    
      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into
      the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg
      made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged
      him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied,
      and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any
      Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement,
      contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and
      hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on
      the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering
      his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and
      behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long
      wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
      striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
      scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is
      using Rogers’s best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the
      less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of
      a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are
      always kept.
    
    
      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
      harpoon like a marshal’s baton.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
    
    
      I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
      grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
      though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
      bedfellow.
    
    
      However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good
      thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,
      afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let
      him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the
      man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is
      more in that man than you perhaps think for.
    
    
      The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
      night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
      nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
      sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and
      ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,
      shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
    
    
      You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
      young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would
      seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from
      his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might
      say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still
      lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has
      tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?
      which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to
      show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
    
    
      “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went
      to breakfast.
    
    
      They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in
      manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the
      great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men,
      they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere
      crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the
      taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of
      Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s performances—this kind of
      travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
      polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
      anywhere.
    
    
      These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after
      we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good
      stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
      maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
      embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
      slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
      strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet,
      here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling,
      all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as
      though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
      Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
      whalemen!
    
    
      But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the
      head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
      cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
      cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and
      using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the
      imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
      But that was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that
      in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
    
    
      We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
      coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
      done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest
      into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there
      quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied
      out for a stroll.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 6. The Street.
    
    
      If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an
      individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized
      town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll
      through the streets of New Bedford.
    
    
      In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
      offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even
      in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes
      jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and
      Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared
      the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these
      last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual
      cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom
      yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
    
    
      But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
      and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
      which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
      more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
      scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and
      glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows
      who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the
      whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In
      some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that
      chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed
      coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with
      a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.
    
    
      No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
      downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
      two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
      country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
      reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical
      things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he
      orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah,
      poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling
      gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of
      the tempest.
    
    
      But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
      bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
      place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day
      perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it
      is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so
      bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New
      England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land,
      also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the
      spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,
      nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and
      gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted
      upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
    
    
      Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
      mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses
      and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
      One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of
      the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
    
    
      In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
      daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You
      must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they
      have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn
      their lengths in spermaceti candles.
    
    
      In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
      avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and
      bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their
      tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;
      which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces
      of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s final
      day.
    
    
      And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
      roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is
      perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom
      of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls
      breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as
      though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the
      Puritanic sands.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
    
    
      In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are the
      moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail
      to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
    
    
      Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
      special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
      sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
      bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a
      small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and widows. A
      muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.
      Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as
      if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not
      yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat
      steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned
      into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like
      the following, but I do not pretend to quote:—
    
    
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost
      overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November 1st, 1836.
      THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
    
    
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER
      CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’ crews OF THE
      SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground
      in the PACIFIC, December 31st, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their
      surviving SHIPMATES.
    
    
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of
      his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, August 3d,
      1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
    
    
      Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself
      near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.
      Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of
      incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person
      present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who
      could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions
      on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names
      appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many
      are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several
      women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing
      grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
      unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused
      the old wounds to bleed afresh.
    
    
      Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among
      flowers can say—here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the
      desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those
      black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those
      immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the
      lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the
      beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might those
      tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.
    
    
      In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why
      it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,
      though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to
      his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so
      significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but
      embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life
      Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal,
      unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam
      who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be
      comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in
      unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead;
      wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.
      All these things are not without their meanings.
    
    
      But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead
      doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
    
    
      It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
      Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light
      of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone
      before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew
      merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion,
      it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes,
      there is death in this business of whaling—a speechlessly quick
      chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have
      hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they
      call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in
      looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the
      sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
      Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body
      who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for
      Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave
      my soul, Jove himself cannot.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
    
    
      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was
      the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a
      very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,
      but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the
      time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy
      old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering
      youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain
      mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping
      forth even beneath February’s snow. No one having previously heard his
      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost
      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities
      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he
      entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come
      in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and
      his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with
      the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and
      overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an
      adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the
      pulpit.
    
    
      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
      seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it
      seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit
      without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those
      used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain
      had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for
      this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a
      mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel
      it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the
      foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of
      the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
      steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
    
    
      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
      swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
      so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the
      pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these
      joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared
      to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and
      stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,
      till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little
      Quebec.
    
    
      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
      that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of
      the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;
      furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by
      that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for
      the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for
      replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of
      God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold—a lofty
      Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
    
    
      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
      borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was
      adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against
      a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But
      high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little
      isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s face; and this bright
      face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship’s tossed deck,
      something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory’s plank
      where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel seemed to say, “beat on,
      beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is
      breaking through; the clouds are rolling off—serenest azure is at
      hand.”
     
    
      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had
      achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
      likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting
      piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed beak.
    
    
      What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this
      earth’s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads
      the world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first
      descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the
      God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds. Yes,
      the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the
      pulpit is its prow.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
    
    
      Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
      the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away to
      larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
     
    
      There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still
      slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every
      eye on the preacher.
    
    
      He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his large
      brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a
      prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom
      of the sea.
    
    
      This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
      bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
      commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the
      concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
    
     “The ribs and terrors in the whale,
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
     While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by,
     And lift me deepening down to doom.

     “I saw the opening maw of hell,
     With endless pains and sorrows there;
     Which none but they that feel can tell—
     Oh, I was plunging to despair.

     “In black distress, I called my God,
     When I could scarce believe him mine,
     He bowed his ear to my complaints—
     No more the whale did me confine.

     “With speed he flew to my relief,
     As on a radiant dolphin borne;
     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
     The face of my Deliverer God.

     “My song for ever shall record
     That terrible, that joyful hour;
     I give the glory to my God,
     His all the mercy and the power.”
 
    
      Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
      howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
      over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the
      proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first
      chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
      Jonah.’”
     
    
      “Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is
      one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet
      what depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the
      fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods
      surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
      sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But what is this lesson
      that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a
      lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the
      living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story
      of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift
      punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of
      Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was
      in his wilful disobedience of the command of God—never mind now what
      that command was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard command. But
      all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do—remember
      that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
      And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
      disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
    
    
      “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,
      by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry
      him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this
      earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound
      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By
      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.
      That’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is
      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed
      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast
      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two
      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of
      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee
      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of
      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;
      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the
      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been
      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,
      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany
      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he
      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye.
      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in
      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the
      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,
      one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do
      you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer
      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers
      from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile
      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold
      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of
      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands
      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his
      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself
      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of
      it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,
      they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.
    
    
      “‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out
      his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless
      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But
      he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,
      sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man
      now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than
      he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the next coming tide,’ at
      last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon
      enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s
      another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll
      sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money how much is that?—I’ll
      pay now.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing
      not to be overlooked in this history, ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere
      the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
    
    
      “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
      in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this
      world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a
      passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So
      Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s purse, ere he judge
      him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it’s assented to.
      Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time
      resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah
      fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.
      He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he
      mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my state-room,
      Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like
      it,’ says the Captain, ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock
      the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling
      there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about
      the doors of convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All
      dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds
      the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath
      the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that
      stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his
      bowels’ wards.
    
    
      “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates
      in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the
      weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in
      slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the
      room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious
      the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens
      Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and
      this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
      But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,
      the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
      me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
      soul are all in crookedness!’ 
    
    
      “Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
      one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
      praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the
      whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who
      bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there’s naught to
      staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah’s prodigy of
      ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
    
    
      “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!
      the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked
      burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when
      the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars
      are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are
      yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah’s
      head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees
      no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little
      hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with
      open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
      down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken
      it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and
      shrieks in his dead ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled
      from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and
      stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at
      that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the
      bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy
      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning
      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face
      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the
      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again
      towards the tormented deep.
    
    
      “Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
      attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
      him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
      fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,
      they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
      upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then how furiously they
      mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine occupation? Whence comest
      thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
      of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;
      whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise
      another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer
      is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
    
    
      “‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God
      of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye,
      well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to
      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
      appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God
      for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,—when
      wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the
      sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them; they
      mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But
      all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised
      invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of
      Jonah.
    
    
      “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when
      instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,
      as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He
      goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he
      scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws
      awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many
      white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the
      fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For
      sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He
      feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance
      to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
      pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is
      true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
      punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in
      the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I
      do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him
      before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to
      repent of it like Jonah.”
     
    
      While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting
      storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when
      describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep
      chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring
      elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy
      brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look
      on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
    
    
      There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
      of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
      eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
    
    
      But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
      with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:
    
    
      “Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon
      me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah
      teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I
      am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from
      this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as
      you listen, while some one of you reads me that other and more awful
      lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the living God. How being
      an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the
      Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,
      Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,
      and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God
      is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon
      him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with
      swift slantings tore him along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the
      eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were
      wrapped about his head,’ and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
      Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of
      hell’—when the whale grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even
      then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God
      spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the
      sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and
      all the delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry
      land;’ when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised
      and beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously
      murmuring of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what
      was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That
      was it!
    
    
      “This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the
      living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel
      duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed
      them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe
      to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in
      this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even
      though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot
      Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!”
     
    
      He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face
      to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a
      heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
      every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
      than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the
      kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward
      delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,
      ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
      arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
      gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
      truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from
      under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight
      is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is
      only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
      billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure
      Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who
      coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath—O Father!—chiefly
      known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal, here I die. I have
      striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s, or mine own. Yet this
      is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live
      out the lifetime of his God?”
     
    
      He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
      his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and
      he was left alone in the place.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
    
    
      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite
      alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was
      sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and
      in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of
      his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling
      away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.
    
    
      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to
      the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began
      counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as
      I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving
      utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then
      begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each
      time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by
      such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment
      at the multitude of pages was excited.
    
    
      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously
      marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance yet
      had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide
      the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces
      of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and
      bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.
      And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,
      which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man
      who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too,
      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I
      will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
      phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded
      me of General Washington’s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It
      had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows,
      which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly
      wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
    
    
      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,
      never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
      wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
      Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous,
      and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me
      upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very
      strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly
      how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm
      self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed
      also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
      other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no
      desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as
      mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost
      sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the
      way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown
      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;
      and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity;
      content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this
      was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there
      was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we
      mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I
      hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I
      conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his
      digester.”
     
    
      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild
      stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only
      glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the
      casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm
      booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange
      feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and maddened
      hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing savage had
      redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in
      which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he
      was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself
      mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have
      repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll
      try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but
      hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
      and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little
      noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last
      night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
      bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a
      little complimented.
    
    
      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him
      the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were
      in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to
      jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in
      this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch
      and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging
      puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between
      us.
    
    
      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left
      us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I
      to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine,
      clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married;
      meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would
      gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame
      of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much
      distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.
    
    
      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
      together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous
      tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty
      dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically
      dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and
      said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by
      pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay. He then went
      about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper
      fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for
      me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a
      moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
    
    
      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans
      and all included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of
      black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do the will of God—that
      is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what
      I would have my fellow man to do to me—that is the will of God. Now,
      Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do
      to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
      Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
      idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little
      idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or
      thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at
      peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to
      sleep without some little chat.
    
    
      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
      disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very
      bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and
      chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts’ 
      honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
    
    
      We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
      Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over
      mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy
      were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little
      nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting
      up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
    
    
      Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began
      to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up;
      the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our
      four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them,
      as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more
      so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too,
      seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because
      truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for
      there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by
      contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are
      all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be
      said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
      the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why
      then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and
      unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be
      furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the
      rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but
      the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.
      Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic
      crystal.
    
    
      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by
      day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
      being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except
      his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our
      essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening
      my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness
      into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
      twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I
      at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
      strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a
      strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,
      that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
      the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love
      once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have
      Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such
      serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the
      landlord’s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed
      confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
      friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
      the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
      hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
    
    
      Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
      distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,
      eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly
      complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his
      words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with
      his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as
      it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
    
    
      Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
      South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
    
    
      When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
      grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
      sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
      to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His
      father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the
      maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
      warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal stuff; though
      sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
      untutored youth.
    
    
      A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage
      to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen,
      spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence could
      prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a
      distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted
      the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of
      land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding
      his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he
      sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding
      by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of
      his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
      himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
      swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
    
    
      In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass
      over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged
      not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit
      Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make
      himself at home. But this fine young savage—this sea Prince of
      Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down among the sailors,
      and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the
      shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if
      thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored
      countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he was actuated by a
      profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make
      his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better
      than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him
      that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
      so, than all his father’s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and
      seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and
      seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave
      it up for lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die
      a pagan.
    
    
      And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
      wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
      ways about him, though now some time from home.
    
    
      By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a
      coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being
      very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and
      added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted
      him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings
      before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as soon as he
      felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail
      about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a
      harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
    
    
      I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
      movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
      this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
      intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for
      an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany
      me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
      the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with
      both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all
      this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for
      Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to
      be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the
      mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to
      merchant seamen.
    
    
      His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced
      me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
      rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
      sleeping.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
    
    
      Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
      for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
      comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
      amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me
      and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
      about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
      whom I now companied with.
    
    
      We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor
      carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to
      “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As
      we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for
      they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at
      seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not,
      going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then
      stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he
      carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling
      ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied,
      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular
      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried
      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In
      short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers’ 
      meadows armed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to
      furnish them—even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons,
      preferred his own harpoon.
    
    
      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners
      of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest
      to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing—though
      in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage
      the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then
      shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg,
      you might have known better than that, one would think. Didn’t the people
      laugh?”
     
    
      Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko,
      it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young
      cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this
      punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where
      the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at
      Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very stately
      punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this commander was
      invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a pretty young princess
      just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at
      the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned
      the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between
      the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being
      said,—for those people have their grace as well as we—though
      Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our
      platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the
      great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest
      opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is,
      dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the
      blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and
      noting the ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as
      having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s
      own house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
      punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
      Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”
     
    
      At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.
      Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford
      rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the
      clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled
      upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay
      silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of
      carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt
      the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one
      most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second
      ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the
      endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
    
    
      Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
      Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.
      How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike earth!—that
      common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs;
      and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no
      records.
    
    
      At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His
      dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On,
      on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;
      ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning,
      we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall
      masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this
      reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some
      time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
      lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
      whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by
      their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all
      verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind
      his back. I thought the bumpkin’s hour of doom was come. Dropping his
      harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
      miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;
      then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with
      bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,
      lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.
    
    
      “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
      “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
     
    
      “Hallo, you sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,
      stalking up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you
      know you might have killed that chap?”
     
    
      “What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
    
    
      “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing to
      the still shivering greenhorn.
    
    
      “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
      expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so
      small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
     
    
      “Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e you, you cannibal, if you try
      any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
     
    
      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
      mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the
      weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,
      completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow
      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were
      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed
      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking
      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into
      splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;
      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it
      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this
      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under
      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the
      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the
      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that
      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and
      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to
      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For
      three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long
      arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders
      through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but
      saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself
      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance
      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and
      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking
      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked
      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble
      trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg
      like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
    
    
      Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at
      all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only
      asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off;
      that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against
      the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
      himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
      cannibals must help these Christians.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
    
    
      Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
      fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
    
    
      Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the
      world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than
      the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of
      sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you
      would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
      gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
      don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to
      send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of
      wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome;
      that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the
      shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades
      in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
      Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way
      inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to
      their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering,
      as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that
      Nantucket is no Illinois.
    
    
      Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled
      by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down
      upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his
      talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight
      over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction.
      Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the
      island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,—the poor little
      Indian’s skeleton.
    
    
      What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take
      to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the
      sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
      experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
      launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
      put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
      Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting
      war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most
      monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,
      clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very
      panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious
      assaults!
    
    
      And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
      their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so
      many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and
      Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add
      Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all
      India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this
      terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea is his; he owns it,
      as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through
      it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating
      forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen
      the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
      themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep
      itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone,
      in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as
      his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his business,
      which a Noah’s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the
      millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;
      he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the
      Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at
      last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to
      an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and
      is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out
      of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under
      his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
    
    
      It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
      anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business
      that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the
      Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots,
      whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in
      all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he
      called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that
      we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the
      directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our
      starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then
      keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to
      the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the
      place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,
      especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our
      first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
      I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by
      dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a
      peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something
      which there was no mistaking.
    
    
      Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
      swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old
      doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so
      that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was
      over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help
      staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my
      neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, two of them, one for
      Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper
      upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the
      whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots
      too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?
    
    
      I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with
      yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a
      dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and
      carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.
    
    
      “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
     
    
      “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”
     
    
      And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs.
      Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known
      our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further
      scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at
      a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned
      round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
     
    
      “What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.
    
    
      “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
    
    
      “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says
      I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time,
      ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
     
    
      But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt,
      who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the
      word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the
      kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
    
    
      “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us
      both on one clam?”
     
    
      However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
      apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
      came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
      hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
      hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into
      little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned
      with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage,
      and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him,
      and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great
      expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s
      clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.
      Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod” with great
      emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam came
      forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
      cod-chowder was placed before us.
    
    
      We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to
      myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s that
      stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain’t
      that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”
     
    
      Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
      name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
      breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began
      to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the
      house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of
      codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior
      old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could
      not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along
      the beach among some fishermen’s boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding
      on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s
      decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
    
    
      Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
      concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede
      me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his
      harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every
      true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s
      dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort’nt
      v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three
      barrels of ile, was found dead in my first floor back, with his
      harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich
      dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg” (for she had
      learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you
      till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
     
    
      “Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
      variety.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
    
    
      In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
      small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
      diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and
      Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
      everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
      harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo
      earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with
      me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had
      already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael,
      should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned
      out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the
      present irrespective of Queequeg.
    
    
      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
      confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of
      things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort
      of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did
      not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    
    
      Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of
      our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon
      Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and
      our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon
      Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set
      about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,
      that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning
      early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for
      it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting,
      humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I
      never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I
      never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving
      Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at
      his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After
      much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there
      were three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the
      Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit
      is obvious; Pequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a
      celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient
      Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to
      the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
      a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
    
    
      You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed
      luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not;
      but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same
      rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if
      anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned
      and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old
      hull’s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike
      fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut
      somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
      overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
      the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled,
      like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where
      Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and
      marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than
      half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her
      chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a
      retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this
      old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her
      original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of
      material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s
      carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian
      emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing
      of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm
      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons
      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly
      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her
      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one
      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary
      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the
      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble
      craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with
      that.
    
    
      Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
      in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw
      nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather
      wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary
      erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;
      consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the
      middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their
      broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually
      sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where
      the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
      Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows
      of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
    
    
      And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
      his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
      ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
      command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over
      with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout
      interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.
    
    
      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the
      elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and
      heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there
      was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles
      interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual
      sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;—for
      this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such
      eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
    
    
      “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the
      tent.
    
    
      “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?”
       he demanded.
    
    
      “I was thinking of shipping.”
     
    
      “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
      stove boat?”
     
    
      “No, Sir, I never have.”
     
    
      “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
    
    
      “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been several
      voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
     
    
      “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—I’ll
      take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant
      service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel
      considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!
      man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little
      suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst
      not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of murdering
      the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
     
    
      I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
      these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish
      Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of
      all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.
    
    
      “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
      shipping ye.”
     
    
      “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
     
    
      “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
     
    
      “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
     
    
      “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
     
    
      “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
      young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
      out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
      are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to
      know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of
      finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye
      on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.”
     
    
      “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
     
    
      “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
      up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah,
      ah!”
     
    
      I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the
      hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,
      “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was
      any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have
      inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
     
    
      “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou dost
      not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
     
    
      “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
      merchant—”
     
    
      “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don’t
      aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each other. I
      have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for
      it?”
     
    
      “I do, sir.”
     
    
      “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’s
      throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
     
    
      “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be
      got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”
     
    
      “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out
      by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the
      world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step
      forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me
      and tell me what ye see there.”
     
    
      For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing
      exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
      concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me
      on the errand.
    
    
      Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship
      swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing
      towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly
      monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.
    
    
      “Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
     
    
      “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon
      though, and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”
     
    
      “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
      round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where
      you stand?”
     
    
      I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
      Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all
      this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
      willingness to ship me.
    
    
      “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
      along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.
    
    
      Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising
      figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg
      was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is
      sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old
      annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning
      about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in
      the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the
      same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good
      interest.
    
    
      Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker,
      the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day
      its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities
      of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things
      altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the
      most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting
      Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
    
    
      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture
      names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in
      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure
      of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown
      peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a
      Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things
      unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain
      and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many
      long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations
      never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and
      independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh
      from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,
      but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous
      lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation’s census—a
      mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all
      detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
      circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at
      the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through
      a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal
      greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one,
      but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only
      results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual
      circumstances.
    
    
      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But
      unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called
      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
      veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally
      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all
      his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
      creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native born
      Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.
      Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe
      to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns
      upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his
      days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
      not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he
      had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man’s
      religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This world
      pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the
      drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from
      that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship
      owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by
      wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and
      dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned
      income.
    
    
      Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
      incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
      task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
      curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
      upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore
      exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was
      certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,
      though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity
      of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate,
      to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel
      completely nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a
      marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind
      what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own person was the
      exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he
      carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
      economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
    
    
      Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
      followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
      was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and
      never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed
      beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned
      up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from
      a ponderous volume.
    
    
      “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
      studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
      knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
     
    
      As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,
      without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing
      me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
    
    
      “He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
     
    
      “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
    
    
      “I dost,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
    
    
      “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
    
    
      “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his
      book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
    
    
      I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his
      friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only
      looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth
      the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at
      a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at
      what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already
      aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands,
      including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays,
      and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance
      pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company. I was also
      aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
      large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,
      splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I
      should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of
      the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually
      amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay,
      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty
      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my
      three years’ beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
    
    
      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
      fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
      that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
      world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim
      sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay
      would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I
      been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.
    
    
      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the
      other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole
      management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what
      the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping
      hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home
      there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now
      while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old
      Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an
      interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on
      mumbling to himself out of his book, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures
      upon earth, where moth—”
     
    
      “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay shall
      we give this young man?”
     
    
      “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust
      do corrupt, but lay—’”
     
    
      Lay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
      shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It
      was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of
      the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest
      consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a
      pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will
      then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a
      farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold
      doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
    
    
      “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to
      swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
     
    
      “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting
      his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also.”
     
    
      “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye
      hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
     
    
      Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain
      Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou
      owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of
      them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young
      man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The
      seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
     
    
      “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.
      “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,
      I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough
      to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
     
    
      “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten
      inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an
      impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a
      leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,
      Captain Peleg.”
     
    
      “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
      insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he’s
      bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start
      my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
      with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
      drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
     
    
      As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
      oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
    
    
      Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
      responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
      idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
      commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I
      made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath
      of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very
      quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing. He
      seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after
      letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he,
      too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still
      nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the squall’s gone
      off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a
      lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.
      That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael’s thy name,
      didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three
      hundredth lay.”
     
    
      “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall
      I bring him down to-morrow?”
     
    
      “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
     
    
      “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
      which he had again been burying himself.
    
    
      “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled
      it any?” turning to me.
    
    
      “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
     
    
      “Well, bring him along then.”
     
    
      And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had
      done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship
      that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
    
    
      But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain
      with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many
      cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her
      crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take
      command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore
      intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family,
      or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself
      much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is
      ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before
      irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted
      Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.
    
    
      “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou art
      shipped.”
     
    
      “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
     
    
      “But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know exactly
      what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of
      sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t sick; but no, he isn’t
      well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always see me, so I don’t
      suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but
      a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He’s a
      grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn’t speak much; but, when
      he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s
      above the common; Ahab’s been in colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals;
      been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in
      mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the
      surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he
      ain’t Captain Peleg; he’s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a
      crowned king!”
     
    
      “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they
      not lick his blood?”
     
    
      “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance
      in his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board
      the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
      ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when
      he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead,
      said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other
      fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It’s a lie. I
      know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know
      what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but
      a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a good deal
      more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know
      that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but
      it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
      about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg
      last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a kind of moody—desperate
      moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all,
      let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it’s better to sail with a
      moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee—and
      wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides,
      my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages wedded—a sweet,
      resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child:
      hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my
      lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
     
    
      As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally
      revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of
      painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy
      and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what, unless it was the cruel
      loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort
      of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know
      what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him;
      though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so
      imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at
      length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab
      slipped my mind.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
    
    
      As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
      day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
      cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
      never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
      even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
      creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
      quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a
      deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions
      yet owned and rented in his name.
    
    
      I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
      things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
      pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
      subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd
      notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
      thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and
      there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be,
      I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
      alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
      sadly need mending.
    
    
      Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals
      must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no
      answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. “Queequeg,” said I
      softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say, Queequeg! why don’t
      you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still as before. I
      began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he
      might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the
      door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but
      a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the
      bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold
      resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the
      landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to
      the chamber. That’s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon
      stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he
      must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
    
    
      “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
      Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
      Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I
      met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
      be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
      locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
      since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
      baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
      Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the
      kitchen, I following.
    
    
      Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
      vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of
      attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.
    
    
      “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
      something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a
      stroke; depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
      up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot
      and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
    
    
      “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
     
    
      “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it
      open!”
     
    
      “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so
      as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying open
      any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
      matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
     
    
      In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
      whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
      nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
      seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
      landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
      Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
      unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
      pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor
      lad a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the
      Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides
      permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill
      both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that
      noise there? You, young man, avast there!”
     
    
      And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open
      the door.
    
    
      “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,
      there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her hand in her
      side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s see.” And with
      that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s supplemental bolt
      remained unwithdrawn within.
    
    
      “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a little,
      for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should
      not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily
      rush dashed myself full against the mark.
    
    
      With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against
      the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there
      sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of
      the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He
      looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with
      scarce a sign of active life.
    
    
      “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
      you?”
     
    
      “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
    
    
      But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like
      pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
      intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
      especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
      eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
    
    
      “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s alive at all events; so leave us, if you
      please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
     
    
      Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg
      to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for
      all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor
      say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the
      slightest way.
    
    
      I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
      they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,
      it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll get up
      sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God, and his
      Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very punctual
      then.
    
    
      I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
      stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as
      they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
      confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
      listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I went up
      stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
      certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was
      just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow
      vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting
      there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a
      piece of wood on his head.
    
    
      “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
      some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But not a
      word did he reply.
    
    
      Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and
      no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
      turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it
      promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
      round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the
      faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of
      Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
      Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan
      on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
    
    
      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had
      been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun
      entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a
      cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again
      against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
    
    
      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion, be
      it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other
      person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when a man’s
      religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;
      and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;
      then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the
      point with him.
    
    
      And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
      now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in
      cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for
      the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common
      sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely
      sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see
      him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.
      Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves
      in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This
      is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy
      notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather
      digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;
      and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by
      Ramadans.
    
    
      I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
      expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;
      only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his
      father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the
      enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all
      cooked and eaten that very evening.
    
    
      “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had
      visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a
      great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard
      or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great
      wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and
      cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the
      victor’s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents
      were so many Christmas turkeys.
    
    
      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
      dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own
      point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third
      understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt
      thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He
      looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as
      though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be
      so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
    
    
      At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
      breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make
      much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
      sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
    
    
      As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
      carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
      from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and
      furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
      unless they previously produced their papers.
    
    
      “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
      bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
    
    
      “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
     
    
      “Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
      behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son
      of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in
      communion with any Christian church?”
     
    
      “Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be
      it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last
      come to be converted into the churches.
    
    
      “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
      Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his
      spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and
      putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning
      stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
    
    
      “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very
      long, I rather guess, young man.”
     
    
      “No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would
      have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
     
    
      “Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of
      Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
      every Lord’s day.”
     
    
      “I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I;
      “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
      Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
     
    
      “Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
      thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
     
    
      Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient
      Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg
      here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us belong; the
      great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;
      we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no
      ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.”
     
    
      “Splice, thou mean’st splice hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer. “Young
      man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I
      never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple
      himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come aboard, come
      aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there—what’s
      that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a
      harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it
      about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
      in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
     
    
      Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the
      bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to
      the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried
      out in some such way as this:—
    
    
      “Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
      spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted
      the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the ship’s
      decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
    
    
      “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
      eye; why, dad whale dead.”
     
    
      “Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
      vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
      “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must have
      Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll
      give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was given a
      harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
     
    
      So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
      enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
    
    
      When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
      signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how
      to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
      make thy mark?”
     
    
      But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part
      in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen,
      copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a
      queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through
      Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood
      something like this:—
    
    
      Quohog. his X mark.
    
    
      Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
      and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
      broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
      entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
      Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
      looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do my
      duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
      souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I
      sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
      the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
      thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
     
    
      Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
      heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
    
    
      “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”
       cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.
      There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all
      Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.
      He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered
      away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went
      to Davy Jones.”
     
    
      “Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as
      I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is
      to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly
      guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod
      here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same
      voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st thou not think of
      Death and the Judgment then?”
     
    
      “Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
      thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.
      Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and
      the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting
      thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.
      Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death
      then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save
      all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest
      port; that was what I was thinking of.”
     
    
      Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we
      followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who
      were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a
      patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been
      wasted.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.
    
    
      “Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”
     
    
      Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the
      water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above
      words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his
      massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily
      apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black
      handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
      directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
      bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
    
    
      “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.
    
    
      “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
      more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
    
    
      “Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole
      arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
      bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
    
    
      “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
     
    
      “Anything down there about your souls?”
     
    
      “About what?”
     
    
      “Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though, I
      know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are
      all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.”
     
    
      “What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.
    
    
      “He’s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in
      other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon
      the word he.
    
    
      “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
      somewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”
     
    
      “Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old
      Thunder yet, have ye?”
     
    
      “Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of
      his manner.
    
    
      “Captain Ahab.”
     
    
      “What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
     
    
      “Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav’n’t
      seen him yet, have ye?”
     
    
      “No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
      all right again before long.”
     
    
      “All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
      derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
      this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”
     
    
      “What do you know about him?”
     
    
      “What did they tell you about him? Say that!”
     
    
      “They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s a
      good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”
     
    
      “That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump
      when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word
      with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
      Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
      nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in
      Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
      calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
      according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them matters and
      something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?
      Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve heard tell about
      the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh
      yes, that every one knows a’most—I mean they know he’s only one leg;
      and that a parmacetti took the other off.”
     
    
      “My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don’t
      know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little
      damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship
      there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of
      his leg.”
     
    
      “All about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
     
    
      “Pretty sure.”
     
    
      With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
      stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
      little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
      papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will be;
      and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all fixed and
      arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose;
      as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped ye.”
     
    
      “Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell us,
      out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken
      in your game; that’s all I have to say.”
     
    
      “And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you
      are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one of
      ’em.”
     
    
      “Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us.
      It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
      great secret in him.”
     
    
      “Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
     
    
      “Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
      man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
     
    
      “Elijah.”
     
    
      Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other’s
      fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a
      humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a
      hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did
      so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
      Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
      his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether
      the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it
      seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for
      the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
      half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
      kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with
      the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn
      fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when
      I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;
      and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
      things.
    
    
      I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
      dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and
      on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
      seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
      seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
    
    
      A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not
      only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board,
      and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened
      that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg
      seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
      look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at
      the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
      working till long after night-fall.
    
    
      On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at
      all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests
      must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
      vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving,
      however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very
      long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.
      But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling
      how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.
    
    
      Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives
      and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
      indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which
      necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all
      grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also
      holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as
      with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the
      numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the
      impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented,
      it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most
      exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and
      loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
      Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and
      spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
    
    
      At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
      Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel,
      and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was
      a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of
      things, both large and small.
    
    
      Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad’s
      sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but
      withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it,
      nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting
      to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the
      steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’s
      desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the
      small of some one’s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her
      name, which was Charity—Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And
      like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about
      hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
      promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship
      in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she
      herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.
    
    
      But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
      board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a
      still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
      Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a
      long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went
      his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg
      came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the
      hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded
      by roaring back into his wigwam.
    
    
      During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft,
      and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was
      going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,
      that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day;
      meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything
      necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest
      with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but
      half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once
      laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so
      soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any
      wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,
      he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And
      much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
    
    
      At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly
      sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
    
    
      It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
      drew nigh the wharf.
    
    
      “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
      Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!”
     
    
      “Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
      us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself
      between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,
      strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
    
    
      “Going aboard?”
     
    
      “Hands off, will you,” said I.
    
    
      “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
     
    
      “Ain’t going aboard, then?”
     
    
      “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you know,
      Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
     
    
      “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly
      looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.
    
    
      “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are
      going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
      detained.”
     
    
      “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
     
    
      “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
     
    
      “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
      paces.
    
    
      “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”
     
    
      But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
      shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
      that ship a while ago?”
     
    
      Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes, I
      thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
     
    
      “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
     
    
      Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
      touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will ye?
    
    
      “Find who?”
     
    
      “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I was
      going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all
      one, all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it?
      Good-bye to ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before
      the Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
      me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
    
    
      At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
      quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
      hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to
      the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we
      went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered
      pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face
      downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept
      upon him.
    
    
      “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
      looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
      Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have
      thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not
      for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down;
      and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps
      we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself
      accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear, as though feeling if
      it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.
    
    
      “Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.
    
    
      “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
      face.”
     
    
      “Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but
      how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are
      heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he’ll
      twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
     
    
      Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
      lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
      over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him
      in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land,
      owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs,
      and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the
      lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that
      respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them
      round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an
      excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
      walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring
      him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some
      damp marshy place.
    
    
      While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
      from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.
    
    
      “What’s that for, Queequeg?”
     
    
      “Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
     
    
      He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
      which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
      his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
      strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell
      upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in
      the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his
      eyes.
    
    
      “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
     
    
      “Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came
      aboard last night.”
     
    
      “What Captain?—Ahab?”
     
    
      “Who but him indeed?”
     
    
      I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
      heard a noise on deck.
    
    
      “Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,
      that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
      saying he went on deck, and we followed.
    
    
      It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes;
      the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and
      several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on
      board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his
      cabin.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
    
    
      At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s riggers,
      and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
      ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift—a
      night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare
      Bible for the steward—after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and
      Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
    
    
      “Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all
      ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
      Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
     
    
      “No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said Bildad,
      “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
     
    
      How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
      Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
      quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well
      as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him
      was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the
      idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship
      under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at
      all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he was not yet completely
      recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.
      And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service
      many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
      heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
      merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good
      with the pilot.
    
    
      But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg
      was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and
      not Bildad.
    
    
      “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at the
      main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
     
    
      “Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before,
      this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
      Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
      be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
    
    
      “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next
      command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
    
    
      Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is
      the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
      known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
      of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
      order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
      in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might now be
      seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,
      and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer
      the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about
      the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three
      days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
      on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his
      sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.
    
    
      Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and
      swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink
      the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my
      handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we
      both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was
      comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be
      found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;
      when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was
      horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his
      leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.
    
    
      “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared. “Spring,
      thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye spring, I
      say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
      whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
      say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved along
      the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
      imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain
      Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
    
    
      At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a
      short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we
      found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray
      cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the
      bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of
      some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.
    
    
      Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
      old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all
      over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes
      were heard,—
    
      “Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
         Stand dressed in living green.
      So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
         While Jordan rolled between.”

    
      Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were
      full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
      boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
      yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and
      glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
      untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
    
    
      At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
      longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
      alongside.
    
    
      It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
      this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very
      loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond
      both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned
      dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;
      a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors
      of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful
      of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the
      deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another
      farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked
      towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen
      Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right
      and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling
      a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and
      holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as
      much as to say, “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
     
    
      As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his
      philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came
      too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a
      word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
    
    
      But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
      him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
      main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
      Careful, careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye,
      Starbuck—luck to ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye
      and good luck to ye all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot
      supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
     
    
      “God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old Bildad,
      almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so that Captain
      Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he needs, and
      ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the
      hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good
      white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don’t
      forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don’t waste
      the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don’t
      whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but don’t miss a fair chance
      either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses
      tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the
      islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep
      that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be
      careful with the butter—twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,
      if—”
     
    
      “Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,
      Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
    
    
      Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
      screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three
      heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
      Atlantic.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
    
    
      Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
      mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
    
    
      When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
      bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm
      but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the
      man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous voyage,
      could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.
      The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the
      unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is
      the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him
      as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward
      land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
      safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s
      kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that
      ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
      though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.
      With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights
      ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the
      lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into
      peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
    
    
      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,
      slavish shore?
    
    
      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite
      as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be
      ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,
      then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all
      this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee
      grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing—straight
      up, leaps thy apotheosis!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
    
    
      As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and
      as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen
      as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all
      anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us
      hunters of whales.
    
    
      In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the
      fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted
      on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger
      were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but
      slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to
      the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval
      officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his
      visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming
      and ridiculous.
    
    
      Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen,
      is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering
      sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are
      surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true.
      But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all
      Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as
      for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon
      be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and
      which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at
      least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting
      the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
      whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
      battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’ 
      plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of
      the soldier’s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has
      freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of
      the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.
      For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the
      interlinked terrors and wonders of God!
    
    
      But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly
      pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost
      all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as
      before so many shrines, to our glory!
    
    
      But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales;
      see what we whalemen are, and have been.
    
    
      Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling fleets?
      Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling
      ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of
      families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the
      years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of Â£1,000,000?
      And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the
      rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven
      hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming
      4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing,
      $20,000,000! and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped
      harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something
      puissant in whaling?
    
    
      But this is not the half; look again.
    
    
      I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
      point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years
      has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one
      aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and
      another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well
      be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue
      all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the
      whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least
      known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which
      had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and
      European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them
      fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which originally
      showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.
      They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
      Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have
      sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook
      and your Krusenstern. For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in
      the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin
      islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his
      marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such
      a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
      life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which
      Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of
      being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!
    
    
      Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
      scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and
      the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It
      was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish
      crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be
      distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation
      of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the
      establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
    
    
      That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given
      to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born
      discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as
      pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship
      is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of
      the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved
      from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily
      dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia
      confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that
      cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases
      carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that
      double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the
      whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the
      threshold.
    
    
      But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
      Ã¦sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
      shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
      every time.
    
    
      The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will
      say.
    
    
      The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote
      the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed
      the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than
      Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
      Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our
      glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
    
    
      True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
      good blood in their veins.
    
    
      No good blood in their veins? They have something better than royal blood
      there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards,
      by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the
      ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers—all kith and
      kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the barbed iron from one side
      of the world to the other.
    
    
      Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.
    
    
      Whaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory
      law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
    
    
      Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand
      imposing way.
    
    
      The whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of the mighty
      triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s capital,
      the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the
      most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
    
    
      *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
    
    
      Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
      dignity in whaling.
    
    
      No dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest.
      Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in
      presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man
      that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account
      that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted
      of taking as many walled towns.
    
    
      And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered
      prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
      but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if
      hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
      have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more
      properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I
      prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a
      whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
    
    
      In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
      substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
      should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
      eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be
      blameworthy?
    
    
      It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
      ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
      gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be
      a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely—who knows?
      Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is solemnly oiled at his
      coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint
      it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?
      Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this
      regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and
      contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that
      anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally,
      that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general
      rule, he can’t amount to much in his totality.
    
    
      But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil
      is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
      oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
      What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
      unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
    
    
      Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens
      with coronation stuff!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
    
    
      The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
      Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
      coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
      as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would
      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general
      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is
      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried
      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,
      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed
      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the
      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight
      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with
      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck
      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as
      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his
      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into
      his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those
      thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,
      steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of
      action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety
      and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
      affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.
      Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural
      reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly
      incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in
      some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if
      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his
      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend
      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him
      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted
      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in
      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I will have no man in my
      boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By this, he seemed
      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which
      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an
      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
    
    
      “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as careful a
      man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall ere long see
      what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or
      almost any other whale hunter.
    
    
      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;
      but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally
      practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business
      of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like
      her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had
      no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in
      fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought
      Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living,
      and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been
      so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father’s? Where, in
      the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
    
    
      With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
      superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
      could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it
      was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
      terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that
      these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which,
      under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and
      burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of
      bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally
      abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the
      ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
      terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from
      the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
    
    
      But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
      abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
      write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the
      fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
      stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
      men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and
      so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious
      blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.
      That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that
      it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with
      keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can
      piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings
      against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not
      the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
      robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick
      or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates
      without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and
      circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
    
    
      If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
      hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
      graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
      all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch
      that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
      over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me
      out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
      mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
      democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
      pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of
      finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
      pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
      war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
      Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from
      the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
    
    
      Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
      according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
      neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent
      air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling
      away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.
      Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if
      the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited
      guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part
      of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When
      close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his
      unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.
      He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
      most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the
      jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there
      is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable
      dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of
      the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something
      which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.
    
    
      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing
      man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of
      grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to
      bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have
      been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of
      the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected
      him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept
      a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy
      reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in
      succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then
      loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,
      instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into
      his mouth.
    
    
      I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
      peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
      ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the
      numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
      cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
      mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco
      smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.
    
    
      The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who
      somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and
      hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor
      with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to
      all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and
      mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible
      danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous
      whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,
      requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time
      and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious
      fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he
      followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years’ voyage round
      Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a
      carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind
      may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made
      to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the
      Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square
      timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of
      many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship
      against the icy concussions of those battering seas.
    
    
      Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
      men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
      Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain
      Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these
      three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their
      long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as
      the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
    
    
      And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
      Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
      who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
      former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
      moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
      and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down
      who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them
      belonged.
    
    
      First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for
      his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
    
    
      Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
      promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant
      of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of
      Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they
      usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean,
      sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes—for an
      Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering
      expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the
      unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the
      great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests
      of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
      woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;
      the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of
      the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would
      almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,
      and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.
    
    
      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold.
      Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors
      called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards
      to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere
      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most
      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of
      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of
      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his
      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white
      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a
      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the
      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the
      residue of the Pequod’s company, be it said, that at the present day not
      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the
      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the
      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as
      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the
      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and
      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American
      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously
      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to
      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like
      manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the
      Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the
      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no
      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly
      all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging
      the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate
      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these
      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the
      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to
      lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which not very many of
      them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he never did—oh, no! he
      went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall
      ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,
      when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in
      with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
      hailed a hero there!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
    
    
      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
      of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
      and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
      only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
      with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but
      commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,
      though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now
      sacred retreat of the cabin.
    
    
      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed
      aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,
      became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by
      the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
      with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly
      could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile
      at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.
      But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness—to call it so—which
      I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed
      against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the
      harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,
      heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies
      which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I
      ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the fierce uniqueness
      of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
      abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief
      officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to
      allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness
      in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers
      and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and
      they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape
      man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a
      space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from
      it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
      sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and
      gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship
      was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and
      melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the
      forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,
      foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab
      stood upon his quarter-deck.
    
    
      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the
      fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or
      taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole
      high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
      unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from
      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny
      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a
      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular
      seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the
      upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single
      twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off
      into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether
      that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
      desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,
      throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by
      the mates. But once Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the
      crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old
      did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild
      hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an
      old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had
      never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old
      sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old
      Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor
      seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
      be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass, so he
      muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
      would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
    
    
      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
      brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
      that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
      white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
      this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the
      sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said the old
      Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
      mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”
     
    
      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
      the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
      was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His
      bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;
      Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship’s
      ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a
      determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
      forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
      officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and
      expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness
      of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody
      stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the
      nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
    
    
      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But
      after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing
      in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily
      walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a
      little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the
      ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the
      sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that
      he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,
      or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary
      there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not
      regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision
      the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,
      out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for
      that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
      brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
      upon.
    
    
      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
      holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.
      For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to
      the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most
      thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to
      welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little
      respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did
      he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would
      have soon flowered out in a smile.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
    
    
      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually
      reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly
      cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as
      crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up—flaked up, with
      rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
      jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
      absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, ’twas
      hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all
      the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and
      potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,
      especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her
      crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these
      subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
    
    
      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the
      old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked
      deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to
      live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the
      cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels like going down into
      one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an old captain
      like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
      berth.”
     
    
      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and
      when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it
      not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its
      place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of
      steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman
      would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,
      gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering
      touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually
      abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
      seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
      the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would
      have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him
      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one
      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
      then.
    
    
      “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where
      such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down,
      dog, and kennel!”
     
    
      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, “I
      am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
      it, sir.”
     
    
      “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as
      if to avoid some passionate temptation.
    
    
      “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a
      dog, sir.”
     
    
      “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
      I’ll clear the world of thee!”
     
    
      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
      his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
    
    
      “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered
      Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer.
      Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike
      him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him?
      Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time
      I ever did pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him
      fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How
      he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway
      there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a
      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours
      out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,
      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s
      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
      guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of
      Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t
      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He’s full of
      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as
      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should like to know?
      Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But
      there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn
      me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall
      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing
      babies do, and that’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are
      queer, come to think of ’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not,
      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So
      here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he
      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that!
      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me,
      and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.
      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?
      how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock
      again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over
      by daylight.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
    
    
      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
      and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the
      watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting
      the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side
      of the deck, he sat and smoked.
    
    
      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one
      look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him
      of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the
      sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
    
    
      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in
      quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,”
       he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer
      soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here
      have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such
      nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the
      strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
      This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors
      among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll
      smoke no more—”
     
    
      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.
      With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
    
    
      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
    
    
      “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory
      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,
      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!
      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But
      what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams
      are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
      kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg,
      only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump
      and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that
      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the
      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed
      pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
      say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a
      whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in
      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’ 
      thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what
      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
      there’s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a
      point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I
      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,
      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
      ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a
      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ 
      says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to
      know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no
      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and
      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I
      saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I
      won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept
      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney
      hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise
      Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I
      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that
      kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye
      here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t
      he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right here it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he
      used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says
      he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right
      good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,
      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.
      It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old
      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
      and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked
      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by
      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t
      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all
      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the
      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do
      you think of that dream, Flask?”
     
    
      “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
     
    
      “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you
      can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever
      he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
     
    
      “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
    
    
      “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
    
    
      “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
      something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
      Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,
      Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this
      way.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
    
    
      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in
      its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the
      Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
      leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
      indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special
      leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.
    
    
      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that
      I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
    
    
      “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
      Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
    
    
      “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as
      to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *
      Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale),
      says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
    
    
      “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
       “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn
      with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us
      naturalists.”
     
    
      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some
      small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men,
      small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in
      little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the
      Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray;
      LinnÃ¦us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
      Marten; LacÃ©pÃ¨de; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
      John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of
      Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate
      generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will
      show.
    
    
      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
      saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer
      and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the
      Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby
      knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with
      which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it
      said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.
      He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the
      long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some
      seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
      sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all
      but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been
      every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
      the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
      without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has
      at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good
      people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm
      whale now reigneth!
    
    
      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
      sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
      succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in
      their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
      reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in
      their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
      excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
      yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in
      any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
      life.
    
    
      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to
      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man
      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor
      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to
      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not
      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in
      this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is
      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
      architect, not the builder.
    
    
      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office
      is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to
      have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis
      of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to
      hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well
      appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the
      hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through
      oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in
      earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.
    
    
      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is
      in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still
      remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,
      A.D. 1776, LinnÃ¦us declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the
      fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks
      and shad, alewives and herring, against LinnÃ¦us’s express edict, were
      still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.
    
    
      The grounds upon which LinnÃ¦us would fain have banished the whales from
      the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturÃ¦ jure
      meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they
      united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
    
    
      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This
      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect
      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, LinnÃ¦us has given you those
      items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all
      other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
    
    
      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
      whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him.
      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.
      A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because
      he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more
      cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that
      all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or
      up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be
      similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.
    
    
      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from
      the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the
      whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with
      it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the
      smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this
      ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire
      whale host.
    
    
      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included
      by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
      contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
      wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as
      whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom
      of Cetology.
    
    
      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
      (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both
      small and large.
    
    
      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
    
    
      As the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO, the
      Grampus; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.
    
    
      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
      Sperm Whale; II. the Right Whale; III. the Fin-Back Whale; IV. the
      Hump-backed Whale; V. the Razor Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur Bottom Whale.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).—This whale, among the
      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale,
      and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the
      Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,
      without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of
      all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far
      the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that
      valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will,
      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I
      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries
      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper
      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the
      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly
      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known
      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that
      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale
      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,
      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but
      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the
      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in
      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its
      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its
      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the
      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from
      which this spermaceti was really derived.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).—In one respect this is
      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
      by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and
      the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article in commerce.
      Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the
      following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the
      Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity
      concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What
      then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It
      is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of
      the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
      Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two
      centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic
      seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in
      the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various
      other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
    
    
      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in
      all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The
      right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to
      elucidating the sperm whale.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).—Under this head I reckon a
      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in
      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds
      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which
      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three
      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of
      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the
      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,
      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is
      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this
      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it
      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat
      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that
      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He
      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going
      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most
      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power
      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this
      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing
      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his
      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a
      theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with
      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be
      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed
      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
    
    
      In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of great
      importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient
      in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to
      attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his
      baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts
      or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a
      regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions,
      which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump,
      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard
      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential
      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a
      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale
      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the
      similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above
      mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular
      combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an
      irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed
      upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has
      split.
    
    
      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,
      in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right
      classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland
      whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by
      his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And
      if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you
      will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the
      systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains?
      nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal
      volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical
      system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for
      it alone is practicable. To proceed.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).—This whale is often seen on
      the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
      towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might
      call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for
      him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has
      a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen.
      He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more
      gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor Back).—Of this whale little is
      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises
      in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does
      anybody else.
    
    
      BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).—Another retiring
      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at
      least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then
      always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never
      chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of
      him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor
      can the oldest Nantucketer.
    
    
      Thus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).
    
    
      OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
      which present may be numbered:—I., the Grampus; II., the Black Fish;
      III., the Narwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.
    
    
      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the
      former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in
      figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does
      not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.
    
    
      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).—Though this fish, whose
      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly
      classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of
      the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of
      moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,
      and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is
      never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and
      pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as
      premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.
    
    
      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).—I give the popular
      fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because
      blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena
      Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
      swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
      whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as
      some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
      themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their
      blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
      thirty gallons of oil.
    
    
      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.—Another
      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar
      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some
      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some
      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn
      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little
      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,
      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the
      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn
      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used
      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell
      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of
      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for
      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it
      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you
      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,
      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however
      that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a
      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked
      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious
      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated
      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
      sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It
      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way
      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black
      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when Sir
      Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended knees he
      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which
      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.” An Irish author
      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to
      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn
      nature.
    
    
      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His
      oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is
      seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
    
    
      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).—Of this whale little is
      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that
      he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The
      Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception
      might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its
      indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and
      Sharks included.
    
    
      BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).—This gentleman is famous
      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts
      the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging
      him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.
      Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws,
      even in the lawless seas.
    
    
       Thus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).
    
    
      DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza
      Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
    
    
      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
      feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition
      of what a whale is—i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.
    
    
      BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).—This is the
      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims
      in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to
      heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally
      hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably
      come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always
      live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can
      withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help
      ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza
      Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and
      delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in
      request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.
      Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you
      that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
      you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
    
    
      BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).—A pirate.
      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke
      him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but
      never yet saw him captured.
    
    
      BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).—The
      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
      known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is
      that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
      he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in
      some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly
      girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no
      fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and
      sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all.
      Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a
      boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called the “bright
      waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate
      colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his
      head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
      escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy
      aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.
    
    
     * * * * * *
    
    
      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans
      of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous
      whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not
      personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for
      possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may
      complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall
      hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into
      this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The
      Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape
      Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered
      Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue
      Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there
      might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner
      of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly
      help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying
      nothing.
    
    
      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here,
      and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my
      word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even
      as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing
      upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished
      by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone
      to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book
      is but a draught—nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh, Time,
      Strength, Cash, and Patience!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
    
    
      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as
      any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from
      the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of
      course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
    
    
      The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by
      the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more
      ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now
      called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
      Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time
      made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s
      authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the
      vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the
      Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
      Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch
      official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At
      present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of
      the captain’s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
      conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
      depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
      officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a
      whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the
      grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live
      apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as
      their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
      as their social equal.
    
    
      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this—the
      first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen
      alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in
      most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part
      of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain’s cabin,
      and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
    
    
      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
      all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
      community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or
      low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common
      luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
      though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous
      discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an
      old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,
      live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the
      quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
      Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
      parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any
      military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore
      the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
    
    
      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given
      to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever
      exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man
      to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and
      though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected
      with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,
      whether of condescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain
      Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the
      sea.
    
    
      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
      forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
      making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
      legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
      which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those
      forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
      dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what it will, it can
      never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without
      the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
      themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps
      God’s true princes of the Empire from the world’s hustings; and leaves the
      highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous
      more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of
      the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead
      level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
      extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances
      even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the
      case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire
      encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
      the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
      forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now
      alluded to.
    
    
      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
      and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must
      not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;
      and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied
      me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at
      from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied
      air!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
    
    
      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread
      face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who,
      sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of
      the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,
      medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part
      of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would
      think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching
      hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,
      unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,” disappears into the
      cabin.
    
    
      When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck, the
      first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
      rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a
      grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,
      “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges
      about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see
      whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes
      up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner, Mr. Flask,” follows after his
      predecessors.
    
    
      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts
      of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he
      strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the
      Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up
      into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as
      he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by
      bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway
      below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent,
      hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence, in the character of
      Abjectus, or the Slave.
    
    
      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some
      officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly
      enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers
      the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander’s
      cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and
      humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is
      marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A problem?
      Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been
      Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have
      been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and
      intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited
      guests, that man’s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence
      for the time; that man’s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for
      Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has
      tasted what it is to be CÃ¦sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which
      there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the
      official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive
      the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
    
    
      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on
      the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential
      cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were
      as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk
      the smallest social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all
      fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.
      I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment
      with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the
      weather. No! And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the
      slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards
      him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it
      tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
      plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
      circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the
      German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these
      cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at
      table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a
      relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the
      hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his
      would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
      degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would
      he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
      strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the
      chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask
      presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the
      ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny
      complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
      marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,
      a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!
    
    
      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is
      the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly jammed in
      point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they
      also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but
      a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon
      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,
      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy
      usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask
      once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of
      an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
      otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much
      relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction,
      thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer;
      but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the
      forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There’s the fruits of
      promotion now; there’s the vanity of glory: there’s the insanity of life!
      Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge
      against Flask in Flask’s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in
      order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a
      peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered
      before awful Ahab.
    
    
      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in
      the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order
      to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to
      some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers
      were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a
      sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and mighty cabin.
    
    
      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
      invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
      the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the
      sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
      with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
      they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.
      Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the
      vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain
      to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the
      solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a
      nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
      accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
      Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy’s memory by
      snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden
      trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle
      preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering
      sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt
      baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the
      black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these
      three savages, Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.
      Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they
      demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry
      adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door,
      till all was over.
    
    
      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his
      filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the
      floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low
      carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin
      framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.
      But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say
      dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small
      mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
      baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
      strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
      dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or
      by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,
      barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
      picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
      round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the
      whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances
      and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would
      ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all
      tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
      Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
      murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white
      waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm,
      but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three
      salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering
      ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish
      scimetars in scabbards.
    
    
      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
    
    
      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the
      ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the
      mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have
      lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was
      something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a moment,
      only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the
      open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no
      companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included
      in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the
      world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as
      when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
      himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his
      own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in
      the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
    
    
      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
      other seamen my first mast-head came round.
    
    
      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously
      with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen
      thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
      And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she is drawing nigh
      home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial even—then,
      her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles
      sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the
      hope of capturing one whale more.
    
    
      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
      ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take
      it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;
      because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their
      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have
      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet
      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may
      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God’s wrath;
      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the
      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is
      an assertion based upon the general belief among archÃ¦ologists, that the
      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly
      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those
      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those
      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new
      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a
      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian
      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and
      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his
      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance
      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still
      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any
      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of
      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the
      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,
      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft
      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars,
      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his
      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London
      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick
      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.
    
    
      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers
      of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is
      plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of
      Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early
      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit
      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the
      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this
      custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,
      that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from
      sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
      helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of
      the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy
      meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the
      silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic
      stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the
      hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of
      the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite
      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
      excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;
      fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have
      for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly
      stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
    
    
      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’ voyage,
      as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head
      would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that
      the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term
      of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching
      to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of
      feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a
      pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances in
      which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch
      is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel
      sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t’ gallant cross-trees.
      Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he
      would standing on a bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold weather you may
      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but
      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the
      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and
      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running
      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps
      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere
      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest
      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
      your watch-coat.
    
    
      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
      pulpits, called crow’s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler
      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the
      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
      crow’s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good
      craft. He called it the Sleet’s crow’s-nest, in honor of himself; he
      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous
      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own
      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise
      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In
      shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;
      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable
      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed
      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch
      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a
      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and
      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,
      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in
      person stood his mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he
      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a
      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,
      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was
      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
      little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges
      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account
      of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there
      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
      the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the
      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s
      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among
      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific
      here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass
      observations,” and “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain
      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well
      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his
      crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I
      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;
      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that
      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have
      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the
      mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches
      of the pole.
    
    
      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain
      Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly
      counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive
      seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up
      the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with
      Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending
      a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take
      a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my
      ultimate destination.
    
    
      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but
      sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being
      left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how
      could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’ 
      standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.”
     
    
      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
      offers to ship with the PhÃ¦don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of
      such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be killed;
      and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the
      world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor are these
      monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an
      asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men,
      disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar
      and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the
      mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase
      ejaculates:—
    
      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!
      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”

    
      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
      “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to
      all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather
      not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists
      have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what
      use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses
      at home.
    
    
      “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.
      Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.” Perhaps they
      were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon;
      but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious
      reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with
      thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at
      his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,
      pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding,
      beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of
      some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
      thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In
      this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes
      diffused through time and space; like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic
      ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.
    
    
      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the
      inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move
      your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes
      back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at
      mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop
      through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for
      ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
    
    
      (Enter Ahab: Then, all.)
    
    
      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway
      to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country
      gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.
    
    
      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you
      would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
    
    
      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought
      was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast
      and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as
      he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him,
      indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.
    
    
      “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
      the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
     
    
      The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
      the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
    
    
      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks,
      and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand
      grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.
    
    
      “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
    
    
      “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
     
    
      When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the
      weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing
      over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from
      his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy
      turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to
      pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb
      cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for
      the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.
      Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
    
    
      “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
     
    
      “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
      voices.
    
    
      “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
      thrown them.
    
    
      “And what do ye next, men?”
     
    
      “Lower away, and after him!”
     
    
      “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
     
    
      “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
     
    
      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
    
    
      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
      convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
    
    
      “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
      whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
      broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.
      D’ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
     
    
      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly
      rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten
      its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to
      himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it
      seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.
    
    
      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other,
      and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises me a
      white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye
      raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his
      starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white
      whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
     
    
      “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed
      the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
    
    
      “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:
      “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
      if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
     
    
      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more
      intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the
      wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately
      touched by some specific recollection.
    
    
      “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
      some call Moby Dick.”
     
    
      “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
     
    
      “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
      Gay-Header deliberately.
    
    
      “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
     
    
      “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
      Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him—”
       faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though
      uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
     
    
      “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and
      wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock
      of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual
      sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a
      squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen—Moby
      Dick—Moby Dick!”
     
    
      “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took
      off thy leg?”
     
    
      “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted with a
      terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; “Aye,
      aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging
      lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with measureless
      imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good
      Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round
      perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped
      for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all
      sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye,
      men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
      excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby
      Dick!”
     
    
      “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye, men.
      Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long face
      about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for
      Moby Dick?”
     
    
      “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came
      here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many barrels will
      thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will
      not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
     
    
      “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
      little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
      me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!”
     
    
      “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
      rings most vast, but hollow.”
     
    
      “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from
      blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,
      seems blasphemous.”
     
    
      “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act,
      the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing
      puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.
      If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But
      ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,
      with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly
      what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
      principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,
      man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then
      could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein,
      jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even
      that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye!
      more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou
      reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye,
      Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men
      from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let
      it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living,
      breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards—the
      unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no
      reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they
      not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he
      laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the
      general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?
      Reckon it. ’Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.
      What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all
      Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has
      clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow
      lifts thee! Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that
      voices thee. (Aside) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has
      inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now,
      without rebellion.”
     
    
      “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
    
    
      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did
      not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold;
      nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the
      hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts
      sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up with the
      stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;
      the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye
      admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye
      predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from
      without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little
      external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these
      still drive us on.
    
    
      “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
    
    
      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered
      them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the
      capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood
      at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s company formed a
      circle round the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every
      man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the
      prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their
      head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden
      snare of the Indian.
    
    
      “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
      nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
      draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it
      goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
      way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
    
    
      “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye
      mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with
      your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort
      revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will
      yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand
      it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not thou St.
      Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
    
    
      “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
      touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,
      radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and
      nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to
      Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,
      interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery
      emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The
      three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb
      and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell
      downright.
    
    
      “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but once
      take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps
      expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
      Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye
      three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most
      honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the
      task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his
      tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, that shall
      bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw
      the poles, ye harpooneers!”
     
    
      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
      up, before him.
    
    
      “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not
      the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance.
      The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith, slowly going
      from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the
      fiery waters from the pewter.
    
    
      “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful
      whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not
      hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
      and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were
      simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and
      shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
      among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
      dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
    
    
      The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.
    
    
      I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
      sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but
      first I pass.
    
    
      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The
      gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the
      crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright
      with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel
      that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not
      gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my
      brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the
      sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
    
    
      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me,
      so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all
      loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high
      perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most
      malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night!
      (waving his hand, he moves from the window.)
    
    
      ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand
      before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match
      itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve
      willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m demoniac,
      I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend
      itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I
      lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now,
      then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s more than ye, ye great
      gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
      ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to
      bullies—Take some one of your own size; don’t pommel me! No, ye’ve
      knocked me down, and I am up again; but ye have run and hidden. Come forth
      from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s
      compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot
      swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The
      path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is
      grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of
      mountains, under torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle,
      naught’s an angle to the iron way!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 38. Dusk.
    
    
      By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.
    
    
      My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
      Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he
      drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his
      impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the
      ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife
      to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he would be
      a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
      plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse yet,
      to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would
      shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow wide. The
      hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish
      has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I
      would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole clock’s run down; my
      heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.
    
    
      [A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]
    
    
      Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
      mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is
      their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark
      the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through
      the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to
      drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin,
      builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its
      wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers,
      and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in an hour like this, with soul beat
      down and held to knowledge,—as wild, untutored things are forced to
      feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee!
      but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the
      human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand
      by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!

      (Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)
    
    
      Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it
      ever since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
      laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
      will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
      predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
      Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the
      old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,
      might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon his
      skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb—that’s my title—well,
      Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be
      coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
      leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
      skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
      out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay
      as a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—
    
      We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light,
         To love, as gay and fleeting
      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,
         And break on the lips while meeting.

    
      A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(Aside)
      he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye,
      sir, just through with this job—coming.

      HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.
    
    
      (Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and
      lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)
    
     Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
     Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
     Our captain’s commanded.—

    
      1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad
      for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
    
    
      (Sings, and all follow.)
    
    Our captain stood upon the deck,
    A spy-glass in his hand,
    A viewing of those gallant whales
    That blew at every strand.
    Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
    And by your braces stand,
    And we’ll have one of those fine whales,
    Hand, boys, over hand!
    So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
    While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

    
      MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
    
    
      2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear,
      bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call
      the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
      so, (thrusts his head down the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight
      bells there below! Tumble up!
    
    
      DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
      this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as filliping
      to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
      butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail ’em through
      it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em it’s the
      resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That’s the
      way—that’s it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating Amsterdam
      butter.
    
    
      FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
      anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by
      all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
    
    
      PIP. (Sulky and sleepy.) Don’t know where it is.
    
    
      FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say;
      merry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,
      Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs!
      legs!
    
    
      ICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my
      taste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the
      subject; but excuse me.
    
    
      MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take his
      left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners! I must
      have partners!
    
    
      SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea,
      turn grasshopper!
    
    
      LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us. Hoe
      corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the
      music; now for it!
    
    
      AZORE SAILOR. (Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)
      Here you are, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,
      boys! (The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep
      or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)
    
    
      AZORE SAILOR. (Dancing) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it,
      stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
    
    
      PIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it
      so.
    
    
      CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
      thyself.
    
    
      FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!
      Split jibs! tear yourselves!
    
    
      TASHTEGO. (Quietly smoking.) That’s a white man; he calls that fun: humph!
      I save my sweat.
    
    
      OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
      they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the
      bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.
      O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well,
      well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so
      ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you’re young; I was
      once.
    
    
      3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling
      after whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.
    
    
      (They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens—the
      wind rises.)
    
    
      LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
      high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
    
    
      MALTESE SAILOR. (Reclining and shaking his cap.) It’s the waves—the
      snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
      would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with them
      evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match it!—as
      those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
      over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
    
    
      SICILIAN SAILOR. (Reclining.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
      interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings!
      lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
      else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (Nudging.)
    
    
      TAHITAN SAILOR. (Reclining on a mat.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing
      girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still
      rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the
      wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted
      quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be
      transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee’s peak
      of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?—The
      blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to his feet.)
    
    
      PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand by
      for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
      they’ll go lunging presently.
    
    
      DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
      holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
      afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
      storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
    
    
      4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
      tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
      waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!
    
    
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the
      lads to hunt him up his whale!
    
    
      ALL. Aye! aye!
    
    
      OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of
      tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none but the
      crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather
      when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain
      has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another in the sky—lurid-like,
      ye see, all else pitch black.
    
    
      DAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m quarried
      out of it!
    
    
      SPANISH SAILOR. (Aside.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes
      me touchy (Advancing.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark
      side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.
    
    
      DAGGOO (grimly). None.
    
    
      ST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or
      else in his one case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in
      working.
    
    
      5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.
    
    
      SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.
    
    
      DAGGOO (springing). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!
    
    
      SPANISH SAILOR (meeting him). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small
      spirit!
    
    
      ALL. A row! a row! a row!
    
    
      TASHTEGO (with a whiff). A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and men—both
      brawlers! Humph!
    
    
      BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge
      in with ye!
    
    
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!
    
    
      OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
      Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st thou
      the ring?
    
    
      MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant
      sails! Stand by to reef topsails!
    
    
      ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (They scatter.)
    
    
      PIP (shrinking under the windlass). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
      Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip,
      here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled woods, the
      last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there
      they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to ’em; they’re on
      the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps
      there are worse yet—they are your white squalls, they. White
      squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just
      now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once! and
      only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—that
      anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God
      aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy
      down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
    
    
      I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
      oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
      hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild,
      mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud seemed
      mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster
      against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and
      revenge.
    
    
      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
      White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
      Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
      few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who
      as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
      For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they
      were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them
      adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom
      or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a
      single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
      separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all
      these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the
      spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
      individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,
      that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,
      or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and
      malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I
      say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.
      Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not
      unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
      attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
      battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
      content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the
      perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
      In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale
      had hitherto been popularly regarded.
    
    
      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
      them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
      whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
      assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
      or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
      those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their
      terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude
      of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually
      come.
    
    
      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
      terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,
      in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And
      as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness
      hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the
      most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly
      astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest
      marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
      waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand
      shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
      hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
      pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by
      influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty
      birth.
    
    
      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
      widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the
      end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
      half-formed fÅtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually
      invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly
      appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that
      few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of
      those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
    
    
      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,
      as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died
      out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among
      them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to
      the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps—either from professional
      inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the
      Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among
      those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never
      hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the
      leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the
      North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
      Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere
      more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
    
    
      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists—Olassen
      and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a
      consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
      incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
      even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost similar
      impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms
      that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are “struck
      with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the precipitancy of their
      flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
      instantaneous death.” And however the general experiences in the fishery
      may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to
      the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in
      some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
    
    
      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
      the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the
      Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised
      Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;
      such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully
      pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm
      Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to
      be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable
      documents that may be consulted.
    
    
      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
      ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing
      only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of
      any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were
      sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
    
    
      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the
      unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
      encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
    
    
      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
      without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
      of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most
      erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the
      surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from
      time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory
      speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes
      whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
      vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
    
    
      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as
      well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that
      some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies
      have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is
      it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared
      that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded
      very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some
      whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never
      a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of
      living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
      mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
      the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more
      wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were
      believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these
      fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
      whalemen.
    
    
      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
      that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;
      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still
      further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,
      but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
      of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away
      unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a
      sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows
      hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
    
    
      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the
      imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
      that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was
      elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a
      high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the
      tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his
      identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
    
    
      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his
      vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
      leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
      gleamings.
    
    
      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
      as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
      accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
      all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
      else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent
      symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,
      and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or
      drive them back in consternation to their ship.
    
    
      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the
      fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s infernal
      aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,
      was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent
      agent.
    
    
      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his
      more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,
      and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds
      of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that
      smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
    
    
      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
      with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That
      captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
      sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab’s leg,
      as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired
      Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
      reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
      encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all
      the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
      identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
      and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the
      monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men
      feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
      half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;
      to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the
      worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue
      devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but
      deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted
      himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;
      all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all
      that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of
      life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
      made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white
      hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
      Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot
      heart’s shell upon it.
    
    
      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the
      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,
      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal
      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but
      felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this
      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and
      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in
      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his
      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made
      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the
      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from
      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his
      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in
      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the
      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with
      mild stun’sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all
      appearances, the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape
      Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light
      and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved
      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you
      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
      form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like
      the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but
      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing
      monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been left behind; so in
      that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had
      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If
      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general
      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own
      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one
      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely
      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
    
    
      This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But
      vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far
      down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we
      here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take
      your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root of
      grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried
      beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the
      great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,
      upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down
      there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family
      likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your
      grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
    
    
      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
      sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,
      or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;
      in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only
      subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,
      so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he
      stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but
      naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which
      had overtaken him.
    
    
      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present
      voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far
      from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of
      such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were
      inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the
      better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
      wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,
      with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
      could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his
      lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
      thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would
      seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
      attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret
      of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
      upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of
      hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but
      half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast
      and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They
      were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars
      from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and
      supernatural revenge.
    
    
      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
      Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up
      of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
      seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
      to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
      to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
      that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their
      insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be—what the White
      Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
      some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of
      the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
      Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
      tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
      pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a
      seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment
      of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the
      whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
    
    
      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was
      to me, as yet remains unsaid.
    
    
      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
      could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was
      another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at
      times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so
      mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting
      it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above
      all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and
      yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these
      chapters might be naught.
    
    
      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as
      if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and
      pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain
      royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu
      placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other
      magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam
      unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the
      Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the
      great Austrian Empire, CÃ¦sarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the
      imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it
      applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership
      over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
      even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
      marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
      symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble
      things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
      the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the
      deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the
      majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the
      daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in
      the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the
      symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire
      worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;
      and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a
      snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice
      of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology,
      that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could
      send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity;
      and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the
      redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the
      great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;
      yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
      honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
      innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than
      that redness which affrights in blood.
    
    
      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
      what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors
      they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent
      mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their
      aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so
      stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
    
    
      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness,
      separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that
      brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only
      rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the
      creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;
      and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,
      the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even
      assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you
      would not have that intensified terror.
    
    
      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit
      by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for
      the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence Requiem
      denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in
      allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the
      mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him Requin.
    
    
      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
      unflattering laureate, Nature.*
    
    
      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main
      hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a
      hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast
      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and
      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some
      king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange
      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham
      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings
      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable
      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy
      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through
      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was
      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it
      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!
      never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name
      for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have
      had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I
      saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor
      knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly
      burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
    
    
      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly
      lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a
      solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I
      have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the
      Antarctic fowl.
    
    
      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;
      with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last
      the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round
      its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But
      I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven,
      when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and
      adoring cherubim!
    
    
      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,
      small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs
      in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast
      herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the
      Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward
      trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of
      light. The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail,
      invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters
      could have furnished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of
      that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and
      hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked
      majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether
      marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that
      endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White Steed
      gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool
      milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest
      Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be
      questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that
      it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with
      divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
      commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.
    
    
      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
      Albatross.
    
    
      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears.
      The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive deformity—and
      yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely
      hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?
    
    
      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the
      less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning
      attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of
      the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some
      historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an
      auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in
      Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the
      desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place!
    
    
      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind
      fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be
      doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most
      appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that
      pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as
      of mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow
      the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our
      superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our
      phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Yea, while these
      terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when
      personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.
    
    
      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing
      he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized
      significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
    
    
      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the
      citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness—though
      for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct
      associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless,
      is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified;—can we
      thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause
      we seek?
    
    
      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and
      without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to
      be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
      recall them now.
    
    
      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention
      of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
      processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen
      snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American
      States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,
      evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
    
    
      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings
      (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of
      London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled
      American, than those other storied structures, its neighbors—the
      Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White
      Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic
      ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while the
      thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant
      dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the
      name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while that
      of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild
      afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of
      sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed
      to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does
      “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor
      unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this
      phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
    
    
      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness
      of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning
      spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of
      anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon
      each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it is not these things alone
      which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can’st see. For
      Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in this
      whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for
      ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads
      over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its
      own distortions.
    
    
      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is
      not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects
      otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror
      in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely
      consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form
      at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two
      statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following
      examples.
    
    
      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
      night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just
      enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely
      similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship
      sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from
      encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,
      then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the
      whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead
      assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down;
      he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the
      mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking
      hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
     
    
      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere
      fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to
      break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
      scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of
      legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
      shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,
      views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
      ice monuments and splintered crosses.
    
    
      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a
      white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,
      Ishmael.
    
    
      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he
      cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
      of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
      creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
      smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
      former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
      bisons of distant Oregon?
    
    
      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison
      herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which
      this instant they may be trampling into dust.
    
    
      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed
      snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that
      buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
    
    
      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world
      seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.
    
    
      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned
      why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more
      portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning
      symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian’s Deity;
      and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most
      appalling to mankind.
    
    
      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and
      immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?
      Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the
      visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full
      of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour of
      atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of
      the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
      or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods;
      yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in
      substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature
      absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
      charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the
      mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
      principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if
      operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips
      and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied
      universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland,
      who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the
      wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that
      wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino
      whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 43. Hark!
    
    
      “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     
    
      It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
      cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
      scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
      fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
      precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
      their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
      only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
      unceasingly advancing keel.
    
    
      It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
      post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
      words above.
    
    
      “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
     
    
      “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
     
    
      “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a
      cough—it sounded like a cough.”
     
    
      “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
     
    
      “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers
      turning over, now!”
     
    
      “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits ye
      eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
      bucket!”
     
    
      “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
     
    
      “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
      Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re the
      chap.”
     
    
      “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
      down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
      our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
      morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.”
     
    
      “Tish! the bucket!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
    
    
      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
      with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and
      bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them
      before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you
      would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which
      there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional
      courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer
      to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
      and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm
      whales had been captured or seen.
    
    
      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
      shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
      almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on
      the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
      courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
    
    
      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others
      were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab
      was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
      certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
    
    
      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it
      might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to
      Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating
      the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling to mind the
      regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
      could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,
      concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of
      his prey.
    
    
      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
      whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could
      he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for
      one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the
      migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
      invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
      On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
      charts of the sperm whale.*
    
     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of
     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
     the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”
 
    
      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
      intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in veins, as they are
      called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
      undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,
      with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel, and
      though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
      straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said
      to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
      vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
      sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along
      this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that
      breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be
      looked for.
    
    
      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
      so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
      without prospect of a meeting.
    
    
      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.
      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for
      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds
      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will
      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the
      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances
      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,
      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former
      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the
      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,
      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,
      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to
      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of
      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only
      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would
      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were
      conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-the-Line. For
      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of
      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the
      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;
      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the
      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and
      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this
      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon
      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to
      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
    
    
      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
      to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
      down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to
      cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the
      premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly
      selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,
      an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before
      him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would
      spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his
      vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should
      turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or
      China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,
      Pampas, Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and
      Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
      Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
    
    
      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
      but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
      whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
      recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged
      thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of
      Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And
      have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after
      poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself
      back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins
      are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear! And here, his mad
      mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
      pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to
      recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
      endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps
      with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.
    
    
      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the
      day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round
      and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his
      life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the
      case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and
      a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings
      shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when
      this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
      the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as
      though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead
      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at
      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at
      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the
      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent
      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the
      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it
      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up
      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by
      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils
      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could
      grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
      fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,
      the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab
      rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless
      somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
      object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old
      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for
      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
    
    
      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
      indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in
      the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is
      as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter
      of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in
      order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any
      incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in
      some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
    
    
      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,
      practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
      citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow
      of itself.
    
    
      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private
      cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years
      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may
      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in
      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common
      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,
      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it
      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the
      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came
      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales
      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective
      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and
      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole
      under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I
      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
      three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have
      heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter
      there is no good ground to impeach.
    
    
      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in
      that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of
      the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a
      whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen
      were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
      would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
      cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
      happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
      salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
      further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
    
    
      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
      celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but
      he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a
      name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or CÃ¦sar. Was it not so, O
      Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
      did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen
      from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou
      terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the
      Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they
      say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
      Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
      tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are
      four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
      Sylla to the classic scholar.
    
    
      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by
      valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express
      object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,
      Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious
      murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.
    
    
      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole
      story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one
      of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much
      bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest
      and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching
      the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
      scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more
      detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
    
    
      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One
      reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
      deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
      however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
      that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
      whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
      bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that
      poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
      to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
      between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
      called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
      that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
      others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death
      by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
      boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!
      not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled
      for it.
    
    
      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
      an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
      narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
      they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
      declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
      when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
    
    
      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
      sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale has done it.
    
    
      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
      cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,
      and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales
      were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
      issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his
      forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten
      minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has
      been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the
      land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once
      more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
      shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
      his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never
      tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.
      I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the
      tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed
      with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
      catastrophe.*
    
    
      *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to
      warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed
      his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short
      interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were
      calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby
      combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the
      exact manÅuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most
      horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from
      the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck
      three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.”
       Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all
      happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in
      my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
      of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that
      I am correct in my opinion.”
     
    
      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black
      night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable
      shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of
      being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,
      with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed
      scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and the
      horrid aspect and revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections,
      until day again made its appearance.”
     
    
      In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “the mysterious and
      mortal attack of the animal.”
     
    
      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally
      lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of
      this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale
      hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.
    
    
      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
      harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the
      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is
      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable
      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm
      whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That
      business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that
      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave
      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s
      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale
      will stand no nonsense.
    
    
      I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance in
      point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must
      know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s famous
      Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain
      Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
    
    
      “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
      were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
      clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
      our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
      the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon
      large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost
      at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board
      till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon
      him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We
      were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
      setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.
      The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
      all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
      some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost
      gravity and solemnity. Captain D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to
      examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
      but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
     
    
      Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures
      as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near
      Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly
      questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates
      every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian
      craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after
      bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
    
    
      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
      of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
      Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that
      just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
      corroborative example, if such be needed.
    
    
      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
      modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four o’clock
      in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
      Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such
      consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to
      think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock
      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck
      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the
      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock
      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken
      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was
      thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a
      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
      mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused
      by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
    
    
      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me
      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running
      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured
      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks
      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often
      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and
      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I
      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a
      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,
      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by
      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)
      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
      amen with Solomon—Verily there is nothing new under the sun.
    
    
      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
      Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
      general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every
      way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
      considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some
      one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be
      mentioned.
    
    
      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
      his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
      neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
      at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact
      thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is
      there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster
      was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other
      reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a
      sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the
      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep
      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place
      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am
      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of
      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of
      war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by
      the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
    
    
      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
      called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
      every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or
      cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large
      creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at
      its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
      reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
      human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove
      the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
      whale.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
    
    
      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
      though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
      passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
      habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether to
      abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were
      otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
      him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
      monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might
      have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that
      the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances
      that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one
      he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
      still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
      with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of
      swaying him.
    
    
      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
      shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for
      example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
      Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any
      more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for
      to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal
      relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced will were Ahab’s, so long
      as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain; still he knew that for all
      this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain’s quest, and could
      he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It
      might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.
      During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open
      relapses of rebellion against his captain’s leadership, unless some
      ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
      him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick
      was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and
      shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some
      way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally
      invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn
      into the obscure background (for few men’s courage is proof against
      protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their
      long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
      think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage
      crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all
      sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the
      varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when
      retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
      promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
      requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and
      hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
    
    
      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
      love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for
      their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric
      Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of
      land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
      picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they
      been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final
      and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will
      not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash—aye, cash.
      They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective
      promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once
      mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
    
    
      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
      Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat
      prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’s voyage,
      Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid
      himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect
      impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end
      competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently
      wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of
      usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression
      gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect
      himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
      and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
      every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to
      be subjected to.
    
    
      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
      developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
      continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s voyage;
      observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to
      evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of
      his profession.
    
    
      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
    
    
      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about
      the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg
      and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an
      additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow
      preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in
      the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible
      self.
    
    
      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept
      passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long
      yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg,
      standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the
      threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly
      drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign
      all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting
      dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time,
      and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the
      Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single,
      ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to
      admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This
      warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
      shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
      Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword,
      thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this
      easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free will, and
      necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
      ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only
      tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given
      threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
      of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last
      featuring blow at events.
    
    
      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence
      that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad
      Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand
      stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his
      cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard
      all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high
      in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have
      derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
    
    
      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly
      peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or
      seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing
      their coming.
    
    
      “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
     
    
      “Where-away?”
     
    
      “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
     
    
      Instantly all was commotion.
    
    
      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other
      tribes of his genus.
    
    
      “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
      disappeared.
    
    
      “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
     
    
      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
      minute to Ahab.
    
    
      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the
      opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego
      had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
      the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to the
      boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors
      at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their
      places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
      boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
      Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,
      while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long
      line of man-of-war’s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy’s
      ship.
    
    
      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
    
    
      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of
      the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles
      and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed
      one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain’s, on
      account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now
      stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly
      protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black
      cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark
      stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited
      turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.
      Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
      tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the
      Manillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and
      by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret
      confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose
      counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
    
    
      While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these strangers,
      Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready
      there, Fedallah?”
     
    
      “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
    
    
      “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away there,
      I say.”
     
    
      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
      sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
      wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
      off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like,
      leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed boats below.
    
    
      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth keel,
      coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed
      the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly
      hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to
      cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon
      the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not
      the command.
    
    
      “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
    
    
      “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
      pull out more to leeward!”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great
      steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew. “There!—there!—there
      again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”
     
    
      “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
     
    
      “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it
      all before now. Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I
      tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
     
    
      “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
      ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
      still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones, my
      boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are
      only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the
      more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils
      are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for
      a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts
      alive! Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why
      don’t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so,
      so, then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and
      strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin
      rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.
      Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons
      and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and
      start your eyes out! Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;
      “every mother’s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between
      his teeth. That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like
      it, my steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
      marling-spikes!”
     
    
      Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather
      a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone
      so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated
      merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer
      invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere
      joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent
      himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped—open-mouthed
      at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer
      force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was
      one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so
      curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter
      of obeying them.
    
    
      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
      across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty
      near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
    
    
      “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
      please!”
     
    
      “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke;
      still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a
      flint from Stubb’s.
    
    
      “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
     
    
      “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
      boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
      Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
      diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom of
      it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It
      ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
     
    
      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as
      the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s company;
      but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among
      them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure
      prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder;
      and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of accounting for
      their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious
      surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of
      wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in the matter from the
      beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen
      creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
      enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.
    
    
      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest
      to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance
      bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures
      of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose
      and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the
      boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi
      steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had
      thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the
      whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
      alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of
      the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer’s, thrown half backward into
      the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen
      steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the
      White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar
      motion and then remained fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen
      simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly
      the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had
      irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly
      discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab
      had observed it.
    
    
      “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
      stand up!”
     
    
      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the
      gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself
      to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the
      vast blue eye of the sea.
    
    
      Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
      commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort
      of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of
      the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its
      top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand, and standing upon
      such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship
      which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and
      short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall
      ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means
      satisfy King-Post.
    
    
      “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
      that.”
     
    
      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
      shoulders for a pedestal.
    
    
      “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
     
    
      “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
      fifty feet taller.”
     
    
      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
      Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head and
      bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling
      landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask
      now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband
      to lean against and steady himself by.
    
    
      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture
      in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and
      cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the
      loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask
      mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself
      with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble
      negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his
      broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked
      nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious
      little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added
      heave did he thereby give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen
      Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth
      did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.
    
    
      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.
      The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary
      dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in
      such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with
      his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant
      like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his
      thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper
      of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
      windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect
      attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down
      all, and give way!—there they are!”
     
    
      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were,
      like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
      couriers and detached flying outriders.
    
    
      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water
      and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass
      of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.
    
    
      “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to
      his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence
      of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar
      whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
    
    
      How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something, my
      hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their
      black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you my
      Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay
      me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
      See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
      head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far
      off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat’s
      stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
    
    
      “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short
      distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes,
      give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em.
      Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s
      the word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the
      devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only
      pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite
      your knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take
      it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
     
    
      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
      his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
      blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the
      audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and
      eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
    
    
      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask
      to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to
      be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its tail—these
      allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would
      cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the
      shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out
      their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that
      they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these
      critical moments.
    
    
      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
      the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the
      brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the
      knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to
      cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows;
      the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the
      headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;—all these, with the
      cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the
      oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her
      boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all
      this was thrilling.
    
    
      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
      heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the first
      unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time
      finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm
      whale.
    
    
      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
      visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung
      upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere
      to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats
      were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead
      to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we
      rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the
      lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from
      the row-locks.
    
    
      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship
      nor boat to be seen.
    
    
      “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
      of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
      There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
     
    
      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that
      the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a
      lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and Queequeg,
      harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
    
    
      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so
      close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the
      mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had
      come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants
      stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the
      mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of
      enraged serpents.
    
    
      “That’s his hump. There, there, give it to him!” whispered Starbuck.
    
    
      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew
      were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white
      curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended
      together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
    
    
      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it
      we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
      water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
      the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of
      the ocean.
    
    
      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire
      upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these
      jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live
      coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that
      storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the
      shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea
      forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as
      propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers. So, cutting the
      lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
      contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif
      pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.
      There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that
      almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man
      without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.
    
    
      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we
      lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the
      sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly
      Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard
      a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The
      sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge,
      vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last
      loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much
      more than its length.
    
    
      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
      tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more
      till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
      against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
      board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
      their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
      up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our
      perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
    
    
      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
      we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
      joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects
      that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own. However, nothing
      dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all
      events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible
      and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion
      gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and
      worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all
      these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and
      jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old
      joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
      only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of
      his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing
      most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing
      like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,
      desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the
      Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
    
    
      “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
      and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
      “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?” Without
      much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand
      that such things did often happen.
    
    
      “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
      squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
     
    
      “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
      Horn.”
     
    
      “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
      by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me
      whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
      oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death’s
      jaws?”
     
    
      “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I should
      like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,
      ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!”
     
    
      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of
      the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in
      the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
      occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively
      critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the
      hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow who at that
      very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft
      with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster
      to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck’s driving
      on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
      Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the
      fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s
      boat; and finally considering in what a devil’s chase I was implicated,
      touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I
      might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said
      I, “come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
     
    
      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
      last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond
      of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had
      done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present
      occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
      Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that
      Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so
      many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and
      burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and
      contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the
      bars of a snug family vault.
    
    
      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
      devil fetch the hindmost.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
    
    
      “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg you
      would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my
      timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
     
    
      “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask. “If
      his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
      would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,
      you know.”
     
    
      “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
     
    
      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the
      paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right
      for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the
      chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
      whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest
      of the fight.
    
    
      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man
      to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of
      the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
    
    
      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
      entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the
      chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
      orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned
      to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for Captain Ahab
      to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s crew, he well knew
      that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the
      Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them, nor had he
      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken
      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco’s
      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure
      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time
      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the
      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which
      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when
      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an
      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he
      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the
      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel
      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in
      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he
      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as
      to any boat’s crew being assigned to that boat.
    
    
      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;
      for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;
      and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found
      tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,
      canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself
      might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the
      captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the
      forecastle.
    
    
      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,
      by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked
      with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a
      half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority
      over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
      concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people
      in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but
      the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
      communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent—those
      insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern
      days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal
      generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,
      and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as
      real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical
      Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
    
    
      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept
      across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de
      Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la
      Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from
      St. Helena.
    
    
      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and,
      by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence,
      not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in
      advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked
      celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.
      Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was
      his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there, with
      the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales
      were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering
      for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this
      old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,
      companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there
      for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after
      all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,
      moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some
      winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.
      “There she blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have
      quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though
      it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so
      deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively
      desired a lowering.
    
    
      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
      t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best
      man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the
      piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving,
      lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many
      sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet;
      while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were
      struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive
      yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab’s face that
      night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were
      warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every
      stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this
      old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every
      eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more
      seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
    
    
      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was
      descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into
      the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing
      again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at
      every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our
      van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.
    
    
      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with
      the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the
      Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and
      wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart
      latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same
      whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense
      of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously
      beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon
      us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.
    
    
      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
      potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
      all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for
      days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild,
      that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating
      itself of life before our urn-like prow.
    
    
      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling
      around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
      there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored
      the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the
      foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life
      went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.
    
    
      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as
      though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing
      appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their
      homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black
      sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul
      were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.
    
    
      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of
      yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended
      us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty
      beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to
      swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air
      without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing
      its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before,
      the solitary jet would at times be descried.
    
    
      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
      time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
      manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his
      mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft
      has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the
      issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So,
      with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand
      firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead
      to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but
      congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the
      forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over
      its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better
      to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of
      humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the
      men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even
      when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose
      in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man’s aspect, when one
      night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw
      him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
      and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
      emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the
      table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
      which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
      clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that
      the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that
      swung from a beam in the ceiling.*
    
    
      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
      compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the
      course of the ship.
    
    
      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale,
      still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
    
    
      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by
      name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head,
      I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean
      fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
    
    
      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her
      spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
      with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see
      her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in
      the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived
      nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast,
      they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
      slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to
      each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
      ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly
      eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while
      the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.
    
    
      “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
      act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
      into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make
      himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
      distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
      were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere
      mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for a moment
      paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board
      the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage
      of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her
      aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home,
      he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the
      world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and
      this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them
      to ——”
     
    
      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in
      accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that
      for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away
      with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with
      the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings
      Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any
      monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
    
    
      “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
      helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
      turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
      wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,—“Up
      helm! Keep her off round the world!”
     
    
      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we
      left behind secure, were all the time before us.
    
    
      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than
      any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the
      voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented
      chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all
      human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead
      us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
    
    
      The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
      spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not
      been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her—judging
      by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had been
      that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the
      question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to
      consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could
      contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But all this
      might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the
      peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign
      seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
    
    
      If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
      equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each
      other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them,
      cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to
      interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting
      in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine
      Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying
      each other at the ends of the earth—off lone Fanning’s Island, or
      the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such
      circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into
      still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would
      this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one
      seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are
      personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear
      domestic things to talk about.
    
    
      For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
      board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date
      a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.
      And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the
      latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be
      destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this
      will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on
      the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from
      home. For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some
      third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
      people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling
      news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all
      the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
      congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
      privations and perils.
    
    
      Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that
      is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with
      Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of
      English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do
      occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your
      Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that
      sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
      sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American
      whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript
      provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in
      the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing
      that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the
      English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little foible
      in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to
      heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.
    
    
      So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers
      have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
      merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
      oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
      mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in
      Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon
      each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they
      first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a
      ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty
      good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships
      meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each
      other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross
      each other’s cross-bones, the first hail is—“How many skulls?”—the
      same way that whalers hail—“How many barrels?” And that question
      once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal
      villains on both sides, and don’t like to see overmuch of each other’s
      villanous likenesses.
    
    
      But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
      free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
      whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “Gam,” a thing so utterly
      unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if
      by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat
      gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and such like
      pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all
      Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a
      scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard
      to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know
      whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It
      sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And
      besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper
      foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting
      himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate
      has no solid basis to stand on.
    
    
      But what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and
      down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson
      never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not hold it.
      Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in
      constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it
      needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that
      view, let me learnedly define it.
    
    
      GAM. NOUN—A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships,
      generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits
      by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one
      ship, and the two chief mates on the other.
    
    
      There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets
      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself
      with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with gay cords and
      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort
      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains
      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent
      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such
      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat’s crew must leave
      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,
      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a
      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of
      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,
      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his
      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in
      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then
      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees
      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only
      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a
      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because
      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make
      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it
      would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would never
      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the
      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as
      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands
      in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy
      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred
      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known
      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to
      seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim
      death.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.
    
    
      (As told at the Golden Inn.)
    
    
      The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
      much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more
      travellers than in any other part.
    
    
      It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound
      whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by
      Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby
      Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly
      heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s story, which seemed
      obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted
      visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are
      said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own
      particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of
      the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab
      or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain
      of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate
      white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
      Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
      Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way,
      that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
      Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen
      in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange
      delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept
      the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s
      main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the
      story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I
      now proceed to put on lasting record.
    
    
      *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
      still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
    
    
      For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
      it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint’s eve,
      smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine
      cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms
      with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and
      which are duly answered at the time.
    
    
      “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
      rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was
      cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward from the
      eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the
      Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it
      was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They
      supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having
      some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those
      latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not
      being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not
      find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather
      heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners
      working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came;
      more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
      sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,
      making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands,
      there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
    
    
      “Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
      favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
      because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
      them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;
      never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole
      of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had
      all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the
      occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal
      overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked
      vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.
    
    
      “‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’ 
      said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
    
    
      “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
      courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large
      and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla;
      this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been
      nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected
      with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand
      fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
      Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with
      many of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
      even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great
      contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime
      approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all
      round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by
      the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet
      thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to
      wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
      wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
      forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic
      genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and
      silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they
      mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago
      villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed
      cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by
      Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave;
      they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,
      they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.
      Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and
      wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for
      Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone
      Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had
      long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman,
      fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this
      Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
      mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
      firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which
      is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been
      retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far;
      but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt—but, gentlemen,
      you shall hear.
    
    
      “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow
      for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but
      only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must
      know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example,
      some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of
      a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his
      duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates
      would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to
      the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the
      westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging
      at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
      length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any
      other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel
      is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
    
    
      “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded
      to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and
      as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his
      own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you
      can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this
      solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that
      it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were
      working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
      gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
      continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain
      spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck,
      and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.
    
    
      “Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
      world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in
      command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance
      he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make a little
      heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all
      events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and
      a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy’s
      snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen,
      which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to
      Charlemagne’s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as
      hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt
      knew it.
    
    
      “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
      rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his
      gay banterings.
    
    
      “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one
      of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I tell ye
      what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his
      part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only
      began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,
      saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of ’em are now
      hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I
      suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him to jump overboard and
      scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.
      But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say
      the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d
      give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.’ 
    
    
      “‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,
      pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’ 
    
    
      “‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
      lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the
      men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the
      lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s utmost
      energies.
    
    
      “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
      forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery
      red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now
      what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle
      with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so
      it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him
      to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove
      some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.
    
    
      “Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if
      boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that
      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most
      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain
      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any
      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
      case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may
      understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.
    
    
      “But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in
      his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand
      this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended
      when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and
      as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s malignant eye and perceived the
      stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently
      burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange
      forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any
      already ireful being—a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by
      really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom
      feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
    
    
      “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the
      deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at
      all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
      sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing
      all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and
      outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile
      advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper’s club
      hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.
    
    
      “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could
      but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the
      conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to
      his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few
      inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
    
    
      “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his
      intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the
      slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted
      hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no
      purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
      when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
      now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on
      the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
    
    
      “‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
      yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
      the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his
      teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
      Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
      with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right
      hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that
      if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But,
      gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.
      Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw
      of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood
      like a whale.
    
    
      “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
      leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
      mastheads. They were both Canallers.
    
    
      “‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
      harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
      they?’ 
    
    
      “‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You
      must have heard of it.’ 
    
    
      “‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
      land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’ 
    
    
      “‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
      proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
      information may throw side-light upon my story.’ 
    
    
      “For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth
      of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most
      thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,
      cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and
      bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches
      over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;
      through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties;
      and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost
      like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and
      often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your
      pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung
      shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious
      fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they
      ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most
      abound in holiest vicinities.
    
    
      “‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
      crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
    
    
      “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
      Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’ 
    
    
      “‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all us
      Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no
      means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
      distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
      surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as
      Lima.” It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
      billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,
      Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
      Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now,
      you pour out again.’ 
    
    
      “Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a
      fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like
      Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he
      indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening
      his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is
      dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his
      slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to
      the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
      visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on
      his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I
      thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of
      the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he
      has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a
      wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is,
      is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
      many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind,
      except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor
      does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
      thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
      probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between
      quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the
      waters of the most barbaric seas.
    
    
      “‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon
      his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I had
      thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and
      holy as the hills.—But the story.’ 
    
    
      “I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had
      he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four
      harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes
      like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought
      to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors
      joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while
      standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a
      whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
      scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran
      close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the
      heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his
      resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all;
      they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
      about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
      sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
    
    
      “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them
      with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come out
      of that, ye cut-throats!’ 
    
    
      “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied
      the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand
      distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal for a
      murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this
      might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still
      commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
    
    
      “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their ringleader.
    
    
      “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you
      want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and
      he once more raised a pistol.
    
    
      “‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
      turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say
      ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.
    
    
      “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on
      the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
      fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy’s
      business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the
      buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;
      ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to
      those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the
      word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us
      decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be flogged.’ 
    
    
      “‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’ 
    
    
      “‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
      ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
      the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
      discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s not
      our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won’t
      be flogged.’ 
    
    
      “‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.
    
    
      “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you
      what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
      shabby rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but
      till you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’ 
    
    
      “‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
      ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’ 
    
    
      “‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
      it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into
      their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
    
    
      “As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
      and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of
      the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for
      the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
      companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something
      down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten in
      number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
    
    
      “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
      aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which
      last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
      through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the
      men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose
      clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally
      resounded through the ship.
    
    
      “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
      the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then
      lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
      after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the
      Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this
      was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a
      scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly
      four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
      The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to
      some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
      discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the
      rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling
      and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of
      the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that
      sought to restrain them. Only three were left.
    
    
      “‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
    
    
      “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.
    
    
      “‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.
    
    
      “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven
      of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last
      hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the
      bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two
      Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their
      hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen
      mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each
      end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
      devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he
      would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last
      night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition
      on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for
      any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was
      more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time
      to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely
      objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two
      comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of
      them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time.
      And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.
    
    
      “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
      separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of
      treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the
      first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby
      secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when
      Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last,
      they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before
      secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze,
      verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound
      the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for
      the Captain at midnight.
    
    
      “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and
      all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few
      minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
      struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies,
      who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe
      for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like
      dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging,
      like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. ‘Damn ye,’ 
      cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, ‘the vultures would not
      touch ye, ye villains!’ 
    
    
      “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
      from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he
      had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he
      would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the
      present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a
      reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
    
    
      “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the
      rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and,
      seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
      traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
      sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
    
    
      “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
      rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take that
      gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’ 
    
    
      “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
      cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort
      of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me,
      I murder you!’ 
    
    
      “‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off
      with the rope to strike.
    
    
      “‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.
    
    
      “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
    
    
      “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
      who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
      two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, ‘I
      won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’ 
    
    
      “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,
      with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
      since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
      tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole
      scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but
      mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain
      dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
    
    
      “‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.
    
    
      “‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking, when
      another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more,
      made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that might have
      been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and,
      sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.
    
    
      “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was
      heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
      besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
      Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
      instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
      sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that
      mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the
      strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship
      reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest
      end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to
      sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her
      leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her
      mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that
      moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and
      Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and
      with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
    
    
      “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
      passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all
      was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
      had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief
      mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half
      way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against
      the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at
      night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt
      systematically built the plan of his revenge.
    
    
      “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
      bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the
      boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In this
      attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable
      vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.
      Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm
      would come round at two o’clock, in the morning of the third day from that
      in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in
      braiding something very carefully in his watches below.
    
    
      “‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.
    
    
      “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’ 
    
    
      “‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’ 
    
    
      “‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length before
      him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough twine,—have
      you any?’ 
    
    
      “But there was none in the forecastle.
    
    
      “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.
    
    
      “‘You don’t mean to go a begging to him!’ said a sailor.
    
    
      “‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help himself
      in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly,
      and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither
      twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball,
      closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman’s monkey
      jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.
      Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm—nigh to the
      man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman’s
      hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining
      soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse,
      with his forehead crushed in.
    
    
      “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed
      he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
      avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to
      take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.
    
    
      “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
      day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,
      drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There she
      rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
    
    
      “‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales
      have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’ 
    
    
      “‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
      that would be too long a story.’ 
    
    
      “‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
    
    
      “‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get
      more into the air, Sirs.’ 
    
    
      “‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
      faint;—fill up his empty glass!’ 
    
    
      “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so
      suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—forgetful
      of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the
      Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the
      monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from
      the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the
      White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,
      undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and
      precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the
      appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal
      spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue
      morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of
      these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
      The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was
      his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the
      prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover,
      when the four boats were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none
      howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at
      his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in
      hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in
      a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost
      back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck
      as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing
      mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back, the boat
      righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over
      into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the
      spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
      seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed
      round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and
      rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.
    
    
      “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had
      slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
      looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward
      jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and
      the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some
      tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had
      destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them,
      and finally wholly disappeared.
    
    
      “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—where
      no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five
      or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms;
      eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the
      savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
    
    
      “The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
      upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down
      the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their
      dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night
      and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the
      vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition
      that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After
      taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as
      possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his
      muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at
      their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
      whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
      miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
    
    
      “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
      to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the
      savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him
      to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a
      pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman
      laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked
      in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
    
    
      “‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.
    
    
      “‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;
      ‘no lies.’ 
    
    
      “‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’ 
    
    
      “‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that
      he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
      stood face to face with the captain.
    
    
      “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
      soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island,
      and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!’ 
    
    
      “‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping into
      the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
    
    
      “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots
      of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived
      at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two
      ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of
      precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and
      so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all
      minded to work them legal retribution.
    
    
      “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and
      the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who
      had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he
      returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again
      resumed his cruisings.
    
    
      “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
      Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
      give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
      destroyed him.  * * * * 
    
    
      “‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.
    
    
      “‘I am, Don.’ 
    
    
      “‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this
      your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did
      you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to
      press.’ 
    
    
      “‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian’s
      suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.
    
    
      “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?’ 
    
    
      “‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who will
      quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this
      may grow too serious.’ 
    
    
      “‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’ 
    
    
      “‘Though there are no Auto-da-FÃ©s in Lima now,’ said one of the company
      to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
      Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’ 
    
    
      “‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that
      you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you
      can.’ 
    
    
      * * * * * * 
    
    
      “‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don Sebastian,
      gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
    
    
      “‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and
      hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
    
    
      “‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen,
      is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it
      happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and
      talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
    
    
      I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something
      like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the
      whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the
      whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth
      while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious imaginary
      portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge
      the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this
      matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.
    
    
      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be
      found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever
      since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings
      of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups,
      and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin’s,
      and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever since then has something of
      the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of
      the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.
    
    
      Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
      be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,
      in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
      that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable
      avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
      into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
      whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred
      to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation
      of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.
      But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give
      the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It
      looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of
      the true whale’s majestic flukes.
    
    
      But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter’s
      portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
      Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the
      sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange
      creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own
      “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of
      that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one
      inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended
      tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the
      Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then,
      there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale,
      as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What
      shall be said of these? As for the book-binder’s whale winding like a
      vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor—as stamped and
      gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new—that
      is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it,
      from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a
      dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a
      whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It
      was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th
      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down
      to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
      species of the Leviathan.
    
    
      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
      at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of
      spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come
      bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original
      edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you will find some curious
      whales.
    
    
      But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
      pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by
      those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some
      plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
      entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale,
      Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the whales,
      like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with
      white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
      prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
      flukes.
    
    
      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a
      Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into
      the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
      Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to be a “Picture of a
      Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast
      of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.” I doubt not the captain had
      this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention
      but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied,
      according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would
      make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my
      gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
    
    
      Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
      benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
      mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In the
      abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged “whale”
       and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly
      whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one
      glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such
      a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of
      schoolboys.
    
    
      Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de LacÃ©pÃ¨de, a great
      naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
      several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are
      not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale
      (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man
      as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.
    
    
      But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
      reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron.
      In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what
      he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any
      Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.
      In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a
      squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men
      seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he
      got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one
      of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort
      of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
      saucers inform us.
    
    
      As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the
      shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
      Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting
      on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their
      deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
    
    
      But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
      surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been
      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing
      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble
      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though
      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has
      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in
      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like
      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing
      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so
      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of
      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale
      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of
      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck, such is then the
      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise
      expression the devil himself could not catch.
    
    
      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
      accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it
      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton
      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham’s
      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his
      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old
      gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal characteristics; yet
      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan’s articulated
      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale
      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the
      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This
      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this
      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in
      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,
      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently
      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial
      covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said
      humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without
      mittens.”
     
    
      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which
      must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark
      much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable
      degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely
      what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can
      derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling
      yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove
      and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too
      fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
    
    
      In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted
      here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to
      be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny,
      Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.
    
    
      I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
      Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far better
      than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All Beale’s drawings
      of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of
      three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His
      frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to
      excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and
      life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.
      Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly
      engraved. That is not his fault though.
    
    
      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because
      it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
      anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
      hunters.
    
    
      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not
      the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken
      from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the
      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is
      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the
      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the
      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially
      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s spine; and
      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you
      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the
      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of
      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub
      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about
      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black
      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault
      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that
      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.
    
    
      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the
      barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy
      bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His
      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a
      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking
      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,
      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale
      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the
      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of
      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in
      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.
      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable
      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping
      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead
      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from
      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.
    
    
      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was
      either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously
      tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting
      action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you
      find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in
      that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his way,
      pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France; where every
      sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings
      and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly
      unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of
      Garnery.
    
    
      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale
      hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem
      entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as
      the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of
      effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a
      pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving
      us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
      miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical
      engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the
      microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a
      shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals.
      I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a
      veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not
      to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a
      Greenland Justice of the Peace.
    
    
      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself “H.
      Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose,
      nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene
      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a
      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,
      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together
      in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with
      reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few
      aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different
      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of
      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,
      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase
      to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;
      three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden
      roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like
      a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling
      whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to
      windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains,
      seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.
    
    
      On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
      crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
      before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There
      are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to
      contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched
      by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me,
      has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an
      incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His
      three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any
      rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the
      western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a
      stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands
      ruefully contemplating his own amputation.
    
    
      Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
      Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes,
      graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks
      wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles,
      as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they
      elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean
      leisure. Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements,
      specially intended for the skrimshandering business. But, in general, they
      toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool
      of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a
      mariner’s fancy.
    
    
      Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to
      that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery. Your
      true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a
      savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready
      at any moment to rebel against him.
    
    
      Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
      hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club
      or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is
      as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but
      a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of
      wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady
      application.
    
    
      As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
      same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of his
      one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite
      as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the
      Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
      suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
    
    
      Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the
      noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of
      American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.
    
    
      At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by
      the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy,
      the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom
      remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned
      churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks;
      but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes
      so labelled with “Hands off!” you cannot examine them closely enough to
      decide upon their merit.
    
    
      In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
      cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
      you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan
      partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf
      of green surges.
    
    
      Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
      girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point
      of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined
      along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see
      these sights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight
      again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and
      longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like are such
      observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-point would
      require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still
      remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old
      Figuera chronicled them.
    
    
      Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
      great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when
      long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in
      battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round
      and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first
      defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have
      boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far
      beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
    
    
      With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
      spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see
      whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
      encamped beyond my mortal sight!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 58. Brit.
    
    
      Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of
      brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely
      feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to
      be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.
    
    
      On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the
      attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam
      through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous
      Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the
      water that escaped at the lip.
    
    
      As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
      scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters
      swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them
      endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
    
    
      *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not
      bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being
      shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
      appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in
      those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
    
    
      But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
      reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
      paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more
      like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great
      hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass
      on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking
      them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him,
      who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.
      And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
      hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly
      be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog
      or a horse.
    
    
      Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep
      with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old
      naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their
      kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this
      may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the
      ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious
      kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect
      be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
    
    
      But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
      have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;
      though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that
      Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one
      superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all
      mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and
      hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a
      moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his
      science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science
      and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom,
      the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
      frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these
      very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea
      which aboriginally belongs to it.
    
    
      The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
      vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
      That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of
      last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided; two
      thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
    
    
      Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
      miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
      when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
      swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
      precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
    
    
      But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is
      also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
      murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
      spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own
      cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and
      leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,
      no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle
      steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
    
    
      Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
      under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
      beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
      brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
      dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
      the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
      other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
    
    
      Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
      earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
      strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
      surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
      Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
      half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst
      never return!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 59. Squid.
    
    
      Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
      way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her
      keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts
      mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And
      still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet
      would be seen.
    
    
      But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
      spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the
      long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across
      them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together
      as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a
      strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
    
    
      In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
      higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
      our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a
      moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and
      silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
      thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
      more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
      negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right
      ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
     
    
      Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
      bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the
      bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his
      orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated
      aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
    
    
      Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
      gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
      ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale
      he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him;
      whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the
      white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for
      lowering.
    
    
      The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all swiftly
      pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars
      suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where
      it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all
      thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which
      the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass,
      furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating
      on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling
      and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any
      hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no
      conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on
      the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
    
    
      As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
      gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
      exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than
      to have seen thee, thou white ghost!”
     
    
      “What was it, Sir?” said Flask.
    
    
      “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
      returned to their ports to tell of it.”
     
    
      But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the
      rest as silently following.
    
    
      Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
      the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so
      very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
      portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
      declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of
      them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
      form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his
      only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water,
      and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains
      his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference
      is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At
      times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the
      detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty
      and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms
      belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the
      sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to
      attack and tear it.
    
    
      There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
      Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which
      the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some
      other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much
      abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.
    
    
      By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
      creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
      to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
      but only as the Anak of the tribe.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 60. The Line.
    
    
      With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
      for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I
      have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
    
    
      The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
      vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
      ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to
      the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
      sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too
      much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
      subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
      means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however much it may give
      it compactness and gloss.
    
    
      Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
      superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
      as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add
      (since there is an Ã¦sthetics in all things), is much more handsome and
      becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of
      Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
    
    
      The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight,
      you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one
      and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty
      pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three
      tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something over two
      hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away
      in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form
      one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded “sheaves,” or layers of
      concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the “heart,” or minute
      vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or
      kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm,
      leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line
      in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this
      business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards
      through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it
      from all possible wrinkles and twists.
    
    
      In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being
      continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because
      these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do
      not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in
      diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a
      craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of
      the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable
      distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the
      painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks
      as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present
      to the whales.
    
    
      Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
      eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub,
      and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
      arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
      to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring
      boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to
      carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these
      instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were,
      from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at
      hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for
      common safety’s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way
      attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the
      end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
      stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him
      into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever
      find her again.
    
    
      Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken
      aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried
      forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or
      handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing;
      and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite
      gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of
      the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill,
      prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a slight
      festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some
      ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the
      bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and
      is then attached to the short-warp—the rope which is immediately
      connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp
      goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
    
    
      Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
      twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen
      are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the
      landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes
      sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for
      the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while
      straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant
      the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in
      play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a
      shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a
      shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer
      sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never
      heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white
      cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the
      six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
      pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may
      say.
    
    
      Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
      repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
      this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
      For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like
      being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in
      full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
      It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils,
      because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and
      the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain
      self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can
      you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing
      sun himself could never pierce you out.
    
    
      Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies
      of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed,
      the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in
      itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the
      ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it
      silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual
      play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any
      other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live
      enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but
      it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals
      realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a
      philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel
      one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with
      a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
    
    
      If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
      Queequeg it was quite a different object.
    
    
      “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow
      of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
     
    
      The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to
      engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
      induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
      which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
      that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
      and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the
      Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
    
    
      It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
      leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
      what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that
      dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;
      though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the
      power which first moved it is withdrawn.
    
    
      Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
      at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all
      three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we
      made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves,
      too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea,
      east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
    
    
      Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
      hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
      with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
      fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
      capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
      glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the
      trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,
      the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
      afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
      enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
      started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
      of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
      forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
      the sparkling brine into the air.
    
    
      “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
      dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
    
    
      The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
      the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
      but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
      that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders
      that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So
      seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but
      silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails
      being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster
      perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank
      out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
    
    
      “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
      Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
      granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
      rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and much nearer
      to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the
      capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of
      his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.
      Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at
      his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.
    
    
      Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he
      was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast
      which he brewed.*
    
    
      *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
      entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
      apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him.
      So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when
      going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part
      of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the
      lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said
      to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a
      sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
    
    
      “Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time—but
      start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried Stubb,
      spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em the long
      and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start her, all;
      but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy, easy—only
      start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead
      perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start her!”
     
    
      “Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
      war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
      involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which
      the eager Indian gave.
    
    
      But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
      Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
      like a pacing tiger in his cage.
    
    
      “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful
      of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.
      Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men
      to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like
      desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard—“Stand
      up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon was hurled. “Stern all!”
       The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing
      along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant
      before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the
      loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen
      blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.
      As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before
      reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of
      Stubb’s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas
      sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like
      holding an enemy’s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all
      the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
    
    
      “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
      by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
      turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
      flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
      here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering business truly
      in that rocking commotion.
    
    
      *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated,
      that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line
      with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart
      for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
    
    
      From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
      the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
      have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the
      other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements
      at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
      in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
      little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
      gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
      clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
      form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to
      bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed
      passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat
      slackened his flight.
    
    
      “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
      towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
      the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
      planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
      flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of
      the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another
      fling.
    
    
      The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
      hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
      and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
      upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
      face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the
      while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle
      of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited
      headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line
      attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid
      blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
    
    
      “Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
      relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along
      the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his
      long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and
      churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the
      whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he
      could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of
      the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that
      unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the monster horribly wallowed in
      his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so
      that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly
      to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
      day.
    
    
      And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
      surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his
      spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush
      after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
      wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
      down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
    
    
      “He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.
    
    
      “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
      Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
      thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
    
    
      A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
    
    
      According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
      off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
      steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar,
      the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to
      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long
      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or
      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the
      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,
      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not
      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while all the
      other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know
      but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work
      very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling
      state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted
      harpooneer hears the exciting cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He
      now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way,
      seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may
      remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking
      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for
      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless
      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them
      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm
      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many
      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
      you expect to find it there when most wanted!
    
    
      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
      themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
      headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper station
      in the bows of the boat.
    
    
      Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
      and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last;
      he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever
      should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any
      fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed
      in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one
      nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the
      fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as
      the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.
    
    
      To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
      world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
      toil.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
    
    
      Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
      productive subjects, grow the chapters.
    
    
      The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It
      is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is
      perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the
      purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon,
      whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby
      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as
      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It
      is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively
      called the first and second irons.
    
    
      But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the
      line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly
      after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one
      should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of
      the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous,
      violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it
      becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his
      movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second
      iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence
      that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
      somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all
      hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare
      coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in
      most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always
      unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
    
    
      Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard,
      it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly
      curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting
      them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in
      general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly
      captured and a corpse.
    
    
      Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one
      unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities
      in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an
      audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
      simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied
      with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be
      ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
      faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most
      important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.
    
    
      Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm;
      so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of
      towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our
      thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly
      toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it
      seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was
      hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the
      great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five
      laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of
      a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
      laden with pig-lead in bulk.
    
    
      Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s
      main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
      dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing
      the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it
      for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into
      the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
    
    
      Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced
      his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead,
      some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in
      him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet
      to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship,
      all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon
      you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all
      hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are
      being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
      But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to
      be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the
      whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through
      the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the
      two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,
      whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*
    
    
      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is
      by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so
      that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the
      chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small,
      strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight
      in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit
      management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass,
      so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow
      suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
      smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes
      or lobes.
    
    
      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on
      deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual
      but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that
      the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the
      time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this
      liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high
      liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish
      thing to his palate.
    
    
      “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me
      one from his small!”
     
    
      Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
      thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
      the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of
      the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have
      a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by
      Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
    
    
      About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns
      of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the
      capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only
      banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his
      own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the
      dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below
      in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails
      against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers’ hearts. Peering
      over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing
      in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they
      scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human
      head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at
      such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
      symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
      things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the
      hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
    
    
      Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
      will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
      round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
      killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers
      over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s live meat
      with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their
      jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the
      dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it
      would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking
      sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the
      invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic,
      systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be
      carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or
      two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms,
      places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
      hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you
      will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial
      spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at
      sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about
      the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the
      devil.
    
    
      But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going
      on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own
      epicurean lips.
    
    
      “Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening
      his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
      and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with
      his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”
     
    
      The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused
      from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along
      from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter
      with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other
      pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping
      along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion,
      were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and
      in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite
      side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and
      resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further
      over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his
      best ear into play.
    
    
      “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,
      “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been beating this
      steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say that to be good,
      a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side,
      don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are
      kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are welcome to help
      themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me,
      if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take
      this lantern,” snatching one from his sideboard; “now then, go and preach
      to ’em!”
     
    
      Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to
      the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea,
      so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he
      solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling
      voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind,
      overheard all that was said.
    
    
      “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise
      dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you
      can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop
      dat dam racket!”
     
    
      “Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap on
      the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way
      when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
     
    
      “Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.
    
    
      “No, cook; go on, go on.”
     
    
      “Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
    
    
      “Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
      Fleece continued.
    
    
      “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
      fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
      tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and
      bitin’ dare?”
     
    
      “Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk to
      ’em gentlemanly.”
     
    
      Once more the sermon proceeded.
    
    
      “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for;
      dat is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
      de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den
      you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned.
      Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs
      from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your neighbour’s
      mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none
      on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I
      know some o’ you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig
      mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not
      to swaller wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat
      can’t get into de scrouge to help demselves.”
     
    
      “Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”
     
    
      “No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’ each
      oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to such dam
      g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is
      bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you den; for den
      dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and can’t hear not’ing
      at all, no more, for eber and eber.”
     
    
      “Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
      Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”
     
    
      Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
      shrill voice, and cried—
    
    
      “Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
      your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”
     
    
      “Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand just
      where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
      attention.”
     
    
      “All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
      desired position.
    
    
      “Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go back
      to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?”
     
    
      “What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.
    
    
      “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
     
    
      “’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.
    
    
      “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and
      don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
      mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
      question. “Where were you born, cook?”
     
    
      “’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”
     
    
      “Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what country
      you were born in, cook!”
     
    
      “Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.
    
    
      “No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
      must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a
      whale-steak yet.”
     
    
      “Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning round
      to depart.
    
    
      “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take
      that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
      should be? Take it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take
      it, and taste it.”
     
    
      Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
      muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
     
    
      “Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
      church?”
     
    
      “Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.
    
    
      “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where
      you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his
      beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell
      me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb. “Where do you
      expect to go to, cook?”
     
    
      “Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
    
    
      “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question. Now
      what’s your answer?”
     
    
      “When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his whole
      air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed angel
      will come and fetch him.”
     
    
      “Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
      him where?”
     
    
      “Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
      keeping it there very solemnly.
    
    
      “So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you
      are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?
      Main-top, eh?”
     
    
      “Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.
    
    
      “You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where your
      tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling
      through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t get there,
      except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a ticklish
      business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us are in
      heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold
      your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart, when I’m
      giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s your
      gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it
      there now, and pay attention.”
     
    
      “All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
      vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one
      and the same time.
    
    
      “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that
      I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don’t you?
      Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private
      table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by
      overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the
      other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are
      cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins;
      have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused,
      cook. There, now ye may go.”
     
    
      But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
    
    
      “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D’ye
      hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.—Avast
      heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”
     
    
      “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if he
      ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,
      limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
    
    
      That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
      like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
      outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
      philosophy of it.
    
    
      It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale
      was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there.
      Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a
      handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with
      barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale.
      Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is
      made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned
      and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of
      Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from
      the crown.
    
    
      The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands
      be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you
      come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes
      away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays
      partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all
      know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old
      train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips
      of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And
      this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally
      left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that these men actually lived
      for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left
      ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps
      are called “fritters”; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
      and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives’ 
      dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that
      the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
    
    
      But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
      exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
      delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
      buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
      pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is;
      like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third
      month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.
      Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other
      substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night
      it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the
      huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I
      thus made.
    
    
      In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
      The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
      whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),
      they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in
      flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is quite a dish among some
      epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by
      continually dining upon calves’ brains, by and by get to have a little
      brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf’s head from their own
      heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the
      reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf’s head before
      him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a
      sort of reproachfully at him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.
    
    
      It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous
      that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that
      appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned:
      i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it
      too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox
      was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on
      his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved
      it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
      the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.
      Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who
      is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
      salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
      will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
      judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest
      geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
      patÃ©-de-foie-gras.
    
    
      But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding
      insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized
      and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle
      made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are
      eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat
      goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the
      Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders
      formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two
      that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
    
    
      When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary
      toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at
      least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For
      that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed;
      and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to
      take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send every one below to
      his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,
      anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each
      couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes
      well.
    
    
      But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not
      answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the
      moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,
      little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other
      parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,
      their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by
      vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure
      notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into
      still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the
      Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,
      to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the
      whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.
    
    
      Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
      concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on
      deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately
      suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,
      so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two
      mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant
      murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep into their
      skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of
      their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their
      mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of
      the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other’s disembowelments,
      but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
      seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely
      voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with
      the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or
      Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after
      what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted
      on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor
      Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his
      murderous jaw.
    
    
      *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is
      about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
      corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
      sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the
      lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being
      used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff
      pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
    
    
      “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage, agonizingly
      lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de
      god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
    
    
      It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
      professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
      turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have
      thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
    
    
      In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
      things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which
      no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed
      up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest
      point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope
      winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and
      the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this
      block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
      attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
      the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body
      for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.
      This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is
      inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now
      commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the
      entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the
      nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and
      nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to
      the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is
      heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the
      whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the
      disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the
      blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it
      stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by
      spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass
      continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the
      blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the
      “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the
      mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
      act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till
      its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease
      heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways
      to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take
      good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch
      him headlong overboard.
    
    
      One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
      called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out
      a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole,
      the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to
      retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows.
      Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off,
      once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong,
      desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while
      the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
      blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers
      forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and
      hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened
      away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right
      beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this
      twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
      blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And
      thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
      simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the
      blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining,
      and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general
      friction.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
    
    
      I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of
      the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
      afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains
      unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
    
    
      The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know
      what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,
      close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from
      eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
    
    
      Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature’s
      skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of
      fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot
      raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale’s body but that same
      blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably
      dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of
      the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin,
      transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of
      isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,
      previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but
      becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I
      use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and
      being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with
      fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to
      read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I
      am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass
      substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so
      much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin,
      so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
      the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
      new-born child. But no more of this.
    
    
      Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as
      in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
      hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or
      rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,
      and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of
      the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
      integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to
      the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of
      the stuff of the whale’s skin.
    
    
      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the
      many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
      crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
      something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon
      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford
      the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,
      if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
      connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm
      Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old
      Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the
      banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the
      mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian
      rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which
      the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back,
      and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular
      linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an
      irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the
      sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping
      contact with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks
      must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also
      seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile
      contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
      full-grown bulls of the species.
    
    
      A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
      whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy
      and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a
      real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over
      his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy
      blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself
      comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
      become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
      North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found
      exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,
      are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are
      refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an
      iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas,
      like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he
      dies. How wonderful is it then—except after explanation—that
      this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is
      to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his
      lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,
      they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into
      the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more
      surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood
      of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.
    
    
      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
      the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this
      world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at
      the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and like the great whale,
      retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.
    
    
      But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
      how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the
      whale!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
    
    
      “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
    
    
      The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
      beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it
      has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it
      floats more and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the
      insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of
      screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the
      whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the
      ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks
      and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours
      from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the
      unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
      wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on,
      till lost in infinite perspectives.
    
    
      There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
      pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In
      life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure
      he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do
      pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest
      whale is free.
    
    
      Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives
      and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering
      discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming
      fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and
      the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale’s unharming
      corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log—shoals, rocks,
      and breakers hereabouts: beware! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships
      shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
      their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There’s your
      law of precedents; there’s your utility of traditions; there’s the story
      of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and
      now not even hovering in the air! There’s orthodoxy!
    
    
      Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror to
      his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.
    
    
      Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the
      Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
    
    
      It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the
      body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm
      Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale
      surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
    
    
      Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on
      the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very
      place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must
      operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his
      subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and
      oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under
      these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh;
      and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single
      peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer
      clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at
      a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel,
      then, at Stubb’s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm
      whale?
    
    
      When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
      till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is
      hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown
      leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head embraces nearly
      one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as
      that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing
      as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’ scales.
    
    
      The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
      hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so
      that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
      there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the
      enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on
      that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
      blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant Holofernes’s
      from the girdle of Judith.
    
    
      When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
      below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now
      deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was
      more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.
    
    
      A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from
      his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over
      the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb’s long
      spade—still remaining there after the whale’s decapitation—and
      striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its
      other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes
      attentively fixed on this head.
    
    
      It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
      intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast
      and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a
      beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head,
      and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast
      dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has
      moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies
      rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this
      frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there,
      in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been
      where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor’s side, where
      sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw’st the
      locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they
      sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed
      false to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from
      the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the
      insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while
      swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a
      righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen
      enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one
      syllable is thine!”
     
    
      “Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
    
    
      “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself,
      while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That lively cry
      upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where
      away?”
     
    
      “Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to
      us!
    
    
      “Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and
      to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how
      far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom
      stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.
    
    
      Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the
      ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
    
    
      By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads
      proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting
      by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not
      hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be
      made.
    
    
      Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
      the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals
      being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
      attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders
      are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable
      distances and with no small facility.
    
    
      The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting her
      own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her
      yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee, and lowered a
      boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by
      Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in
      question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token of that proceeding
      being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a
      malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of
      infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though himself and boat’s crew
      remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an
      incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously
      adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to
      come into direct contact with the Pequod.
    
    
      But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
      interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s
      boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
      Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew
      very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the
      sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way
      ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again.
      Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
      conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not
      without still another interruption of a very different sort.
    
    
      Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular appearance,
      even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all
      totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his
      face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted,
      cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the
      overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep,
      settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
    
    
      So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed—“That’s
      he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho’s company told
      us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a
      certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the
      Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it
      seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency
      over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:
    
    
      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,
      was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having
      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning
      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and
      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam’s whaling
      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship’s getting out of
      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself
      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He
      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of
      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching
      earnestness with which he declared these things;—the dark, daring
      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural
      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of
      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.
      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much
      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
      apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first
      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials—devoting
      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention
      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the
      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if
      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was
      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to
      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass
      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all
      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole
      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The
      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;
      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,
      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they
      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
      return to the Pequod.
    
    
      “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
      Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”
     
    
      But now Gabriel started to his feet.
    
    
      “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
      plague!”
     
    
      “Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But
      that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
      drowned all speech.
    
    
      “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
      back.
    
    
      “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible
      tail!”
     
    
      “I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as
      if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
      succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
      caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted
      sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen
      eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature
      seemed to warrant.
    
    
      When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning
      Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,
      whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued
      with him.
    
    
      It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a
      whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby
      Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,
      Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in
      case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing
      the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the
      Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby
      Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned
      with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling
      to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations
      and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
      With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous,
      unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast.
      Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one
      arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to
      the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate,
      was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his
      tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to
      get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from
      the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out
      of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
      furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in
      his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a
      chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the
      mate for ever sank.
    
    
      It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
      Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
      Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener
      the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman
      stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest of
      all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body
      has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible; the man
      being stark dead.
    
    
      The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
      from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”
       Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
      the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;
      because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
      fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
      one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
      wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.
    
    
      Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
      that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended
      to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab
      answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his
      feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward
      pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down
      there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”
     
    
      Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
      bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers,
      if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
     
    
      Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
      whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon
      the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most
      letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining
      an age of two or three years or more.
    
    
      Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,
      damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of
      being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself
      might well have been the post-boy.
    
    
      “Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but a
      dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
      long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
      insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its
      coming any closer to the ship.
    
    
      Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
      woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr.
      Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”
     
    
      “Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let me
      have it.”
     
    
      “Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going that
      way.”
     
    
      “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
      receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he caught
      it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as
      he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted
      a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter
      suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He clutched it in an
      instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it
      thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s feet. Then Gabriel
      shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that
      manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.
    
    
      As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of
      the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
      affair.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
    
    
      In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there
      is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are
      wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in
      any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done
      everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of
      the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that
      upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the blubber-hook was
      inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But
      how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that
      hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty
      it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for the special
      purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that
      the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or
      stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost
      entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down
      there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer
      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass
      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,
      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in
      which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one
      had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
    
    
      Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in
      his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend
      upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’s
      back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long
      cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there
      in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope,
      attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.
    
    
      It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
      proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
      ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather
      one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded;
      and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor
      demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his
      wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my
      own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous
      liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.
    
    
      So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that
      while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that
      my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that
      my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another’s mistake or
      misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.
      Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for
      its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet
      still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between
      the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further
      pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise
      situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way
      or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If
      your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you
      poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding
      caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil
      chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
      sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor
      could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management
      of one end of it.*
    
    
      *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
      that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement
      upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in
      order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee
      for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.
    
    
      I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale
      and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
      rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he
      was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
      night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
      blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures
      swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
    
    
      And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside
      with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that
      attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously
      carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
    
    
      Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous
      finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.
      Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the
      poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a
      peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another
      protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
      Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades,
      wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This
      procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of
      them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty
      zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the
      sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those
      indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a
      tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that
      great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo,
      and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
    
    
      Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and
      then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it,
      after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in
      this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
      sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and
      spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
    
    
      But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as
      with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up
      the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the
      side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance
      hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a
      cup of tepid ginger and water!
    
    
      “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes,
      this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing
      as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished
      steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to
      tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger
      the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering
      cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer
      matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger, I
      say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.”
     
    
      “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,”
       he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from
      forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you
      please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr.
      Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there,
      this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I
      ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life
      into a half-drowned man?”
     
    
      “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a harpooneer;
      none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You
      have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket
      the proceeds, do ye?”
     
    
      “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
      ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
      only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
     
    
      “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the
      lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It
      is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
     
    
      “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”
     
    
      “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
      that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
     
    
      “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
     
    
      When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
      of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was
      handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that was
      freely given to the waves.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk over Him.
    
    
      It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
      prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it continue
      hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the
      present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is
      to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
    
    
      Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted
      into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual
      tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that
      but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And
      though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior
      creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them
      at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts
      without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought
      alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the announcement was made
      that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.
    
    
      Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
      boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and
      further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the
      mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
      tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
      both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
      plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
      towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it
      seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,
      within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if
      diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats,
      which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly
      dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs,
      and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope,
      and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the
      ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
      they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
      plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them
      under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they
      stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt
      running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping
      beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and
      quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like
      bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to
      sight, and once more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale
      abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of
      the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
      circuit.
    
    
      Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking
      him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus
      round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks
      that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body, rushed to the fresh
      blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager
      Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten
      rock.
    
    
      At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
      turned upon his back a corpse.
    
    
      While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
      and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
      conversation ensued between them.
    
    
      “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb,
      not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a
      leviathan.
    
    
      “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,
      “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s head
      hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale’s on the
      larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards
      capsize?”
     
    
      “Why not?
    
    
      “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and
      he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think he’ll
      charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap, Stubb. Did
      you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’s
      head, Stubb?”
     
    
      “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
      dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down
      there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
      hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
      disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
      stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you don’t
      see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled
      away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he’s
      always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
     
    
      “He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
      seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
     
    
      “No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
      see, in the eye of the rigging.”
     
    
      “What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
     
    
      “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
     
    
      “Bargain?—about what?”
     
    
      “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the
      devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his
      silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he’ll
      surrender Moby Dick.”
     
    
      “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
     
    
      “I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I
      tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship
      once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and
      inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked
      the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, ‘I
      want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old governor. ‘What business is that of
      yours,’ says the devil, getting mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take
      him,’ says the governor—and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t
      give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I’ll eat
      this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain’t you all ready
      there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get the whale alongside.”
     
    
      “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when
      at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the
      ship, “but I can’t remember where.”
     
    
      “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye
      read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
     
    
      “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb,
      do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same
      you say is now on board the Pequod?”
     
    
      “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live for
      ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson
      a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get
      into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole?
      Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
     
    
      “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
     
    
      “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s the
      figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string along
      in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn’t begin
      to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn’t show hoops
      enough to make oughts enough.”
     
    
      “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
      meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he’s
      so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for
      ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that?
    
    
      “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
     
    
      “But he’d crawl back.”
     
    
      “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
     
    
      “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes,
      and drown you—what then?”
     
    
      “I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black eyes
      that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin again for a
      long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and
      hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil,
      Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid of him, except
      the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as
      he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a
      bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he’d roast for
      him? There’s a governor!”
     
    
      “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
     
    
      “Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to
      keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going
      on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here,
      Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I’ll
      make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give
      him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the
      stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself
      docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the poor
      satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
     
    
      “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
     
    
      “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
     
    
      “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
     
    
      “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
     
    
      The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
      fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.
    
    
      “Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right
      whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”
     
    
      In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
      leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of
      both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
      well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go over
      that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come back
      again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming
      boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then
      you will float light and right.
    
    
      In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
      ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case
      of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole,
      but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted
      on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the
      crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done.
      The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship
      not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.
    
    
      Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever and
      anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand.
      And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while,
      if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and
      lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were
      bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    
    
      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join
      them, and lay together our own.
    
    
      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly
      hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all
      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them
      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment
      hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we may freely go from one to the
      other, by merely stepping across the deck:—where, I should like to
      know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than
      here?
    
    
      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly
      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold
      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of
      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving
      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the
      fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
     
    
      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the
      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
      magnitude of the head.
    
    
      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain
      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he
      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes
      corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how
      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.
      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision
      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more
      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with
      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more
      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have
      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed,
      but his eyes?
    
    
      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the
      whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid
      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes
      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which
      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one
      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;
      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man
      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with
      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are
      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the
      view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne
      in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some
      subsequent scenes.
    
    
      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is
      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever
      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him,
      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one
      glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to
      examine any two things—however large or however small—at one
      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and
      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and
      surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one
      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other
      will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,
      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
      combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time
      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and
      the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as
      marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go
      through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor,
      strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.
    
    
      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset
      by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so
      common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the
      helpless perplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically
      opposite powers of vision must involve them.
    
    
      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between
      the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external
      opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a
      membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
    
    
      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world
      through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is
      smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of
      Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
      hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
      Subtilize it.
    
    
      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
      over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by
      a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that
      the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might
      descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us
      hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really
      beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or
      rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
    
    
      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like
      the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end,
      instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and
      expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas!
      it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall
      with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms
      down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with
      his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at
      right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship’s jib-boom. This
      whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
      hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed,
      leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his
      tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.
    
    
      In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
      artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
      extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white
      whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
    
    
      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
      anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
      work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
      dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg
      lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle
      being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
      teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled
      after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and
      piled away like joists for building houses.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
    
    
      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale’s
      head.
    
    
      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
      so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather inelegant
      resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old
      Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker’s last. And in this
      same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming
      brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
    
    
      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for
      an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
      sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the Southern
      fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,
      you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird’s nest
      in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
      here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
      unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown”
       also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
      thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,
      whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.
      But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a
      diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
      there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long
      and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons
      of oil and more.
    
    
      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The
      fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important
      interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the
      beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide
      into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be
      the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah
      went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp
      angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
      arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
      scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which
      depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those
      Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges
      of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
      Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
      fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.
      In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there
      are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some
      whalemen calculate the creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its
      circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
      demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,
      if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than
      at first glance will seem reasonable.
    
    
      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
      “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
      “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
      upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
     
    
      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper
      part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a
      rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.
    
    
      As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
       “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long
      been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was in its
      glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient
      dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;
      even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly
      under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
      the same bone.
    
    
      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
      in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
      colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you
      were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand
      pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey—the
      tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very
      fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This
      particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a
      six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.
    
    
      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that
      the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.
      To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no
      ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the
      Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
      bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the
      Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
    
    
      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
      together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
      not be very long in following.
    
    
      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same he
      died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
      away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born
      of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head’s
      expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the
      vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head
      seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This
      Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who
      might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
    
    
      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you, as
      a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate
      it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,
      intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.
      Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this
      matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most
      appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in
      all recorded history.
    
    
      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
      front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water;
      you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
      backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
      receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
      under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
      were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no
      external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on
      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s
      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of
      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the
      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there
      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this
      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon
      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you
      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably
      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have
      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind
      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about
      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,
      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed
      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently
      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were
      paved with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
    
    
      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there
      a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest
      of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have
      snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this
      sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to
      this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
      what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of distension
      or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know, has no such
      provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable manner in
      which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and anon
      swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed
      elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head;
      it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical
      lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
      destructive of all elements contributes.
    
    
      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
      and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of
      tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by
      the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So
      that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and
      concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster;
      when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I
      trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to
      abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the
      Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not
      elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are
      but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing
      for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the
      provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread
      goddess’s veil at Lais?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
    
    
      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
      upon.
    
    
      Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is
      the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
      wall of a thick tendinous substance.
    
    
      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
      sides.
    
    
      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated
      cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
      upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh
      Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically
      carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable
      strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
      Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most
      excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
      contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
      highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous
      state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
      the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
      exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
      forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is
      just forming in water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five
      hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
      considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise
      irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.
    
    
      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly
      have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of
      a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale’s case.
    
    
      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
      has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the
      whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
      of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship’s
      side.
    
    
      As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought close
      to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
      magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
      untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
      invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
      is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the
      enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make
      quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
    
    
      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
      this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
      Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
    
    
      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part
      where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a
      light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling
      through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down
      from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and
      firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part,
      the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit
      of the head. There—still high elevated above the rest of the
      company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish Muezzin
      calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for
      the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he
      proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this
      cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
      well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
      end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert
      hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom
      another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into
      the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it
      entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up
      comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk.
      Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by
      an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting
      aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
      yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder
      and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of
      the pole have gone down.
    
    
      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
      queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
      was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold
      on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place
      where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One
      himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
      reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as
      the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my God! poor
      Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
      dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a
      horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
    
    
      “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
      came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot into
      it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself,
      the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before
      Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a
      terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head
      throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment
      seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian
      unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he
      had sunk.
    
    
      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the
      whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one
      of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast
      vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and
      shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the
      entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of
      giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the
      head.
    
    
      “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would
      still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed
      down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried
      harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
    
    
      “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
      there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket
      on top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
     
    
      “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.
    
    
      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped
      into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly
      relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and
      all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the sailors’ 
      heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray,
      was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
      But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with
      a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over
      the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had
      dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye
      counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the
      sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat
      alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.
    
    
      “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
      forth from the grass over a grave.
    
    
      “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful
      shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one
      hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into
      the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
    
    
      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges
      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his
      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out
      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a
      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,
      and might occasion great trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by
      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so
      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—head
      foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be
      expected.
    
    
      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,
      the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
      accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
      hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
      Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,
      riding and rowing.
    
    
      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to seem
      incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen
      or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which
      not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian’s,
      considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale’s
      well.
    
    
      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a
      far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all,
      but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly
      emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous
      wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance, as I have
      before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in
      it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance
      was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of
      the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
      deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his
      agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running
      delivery, so it was.
    
    
      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and
      sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
      recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
      honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,
      that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and sweetly
      perished there?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
    
    
      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as
      yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
      Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for
      Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.
      Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various
      faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds,
      serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of
      expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim
      failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics
      of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a
      pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I
      will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.
    
    
      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous
      of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls
      their combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as
      an external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the
      whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower
      of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the
      scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated
      open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias’s marble Jove,
      and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a
      magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency
      which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.
      Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been
      impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head
      in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by
      the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
      royal beadle on his throne.
    
    
      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be
      had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect
      is sublime.
    
    
      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a
      touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the
      elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that
      great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It
      signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most creatures,
      nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land
      lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare’s
      or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves
      seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the
      forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending
      there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
      But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
      inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that
      full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly
      than in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one
      point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes,
      ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad
      firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the
      doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous
      brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon
      you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
      depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark of
      genius.
    
    
      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical
      silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to
      the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their child-magian
      thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is
      tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so
      exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any
      highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the
      merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now
      egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to
      Jove’s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
    
    
      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no
      Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s face.
      Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If
      then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the
      simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how
      may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale’s
      brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
    
    
      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
      brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.
    
    
      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in
      length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the
      side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.
      But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth—reposes
      the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at least twenty
      feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast
      outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications
      of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have
      known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any
      other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards
      of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions,
      to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his
      general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his
      intelligence.
    
    
      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the
      creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true
      brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,
      like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.
    
    
      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of
      its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance
      to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point
      of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human
      magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would involuntarily
      confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its
      summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man had no
      self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along
      with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best
      form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception
      of what the most exalted potency is.
    
    
      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you will
      be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrÃ¦ to a strung necklace of
      dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It
      is a German conceit, that the vertebrÃ¦ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.
      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the
      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrÃ¦ of which he was
      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I
      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not
      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.
      For I believe that much of a man’s character will be found betokened in
      his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you
      are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I
      rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
      fling half out to the world.
    
    
      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight
      in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it
      passes through the remaining vertebrÃ¦ the canal tapers in size, but for a
      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this
      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
      spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.
      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to
      that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable
      to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in
      this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
      more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal
      cord.
    
    
      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would
      merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm
      Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the
      larger vertebrÃ¦, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould
      of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the
      organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the
      great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
    
    
      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick
      De Deer, master, of Bremen.
    
    
      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals
      of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in
      the Pacific.
    
    
      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
      bows instead of the stern.
    
    
      “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
      wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
     
    
      “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
      tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s
      all right, is the Yarman.”
     
    
      “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He’s
      out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
     
    
      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
    
    
      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
      what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced
      his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
      conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching
      his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his
      last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet
      captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was
      indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a clean one (that is, an
      empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
    
    
      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
      ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round
      his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
    
    
      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
      that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’s keels.
      There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were
      going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their
      flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a
      great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment
      upon the sea.
    
    
      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
      old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the
      unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
      jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod
      in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such
      venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their
      wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the
      white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell
      formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and
      laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
      in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
      seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters
      behind him to upbubble.
    
    
      “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds
      are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever
      knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must
      be, he’s lost his tiller.”
     
    
      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
      of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so
      did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning
      over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the
      unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in
      battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
    
    
      “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
      arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
    
    
      “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
      German will have him.”
     
    
      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable
      whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with
      such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At
      this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three German boats last
      lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick’s boat still led the
      chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing
      they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be
      enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass
      him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
      and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
      other boats.
    
    
      “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and dares
      me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!”—then
      in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!”
     
    
      “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s
      against my religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—Pull—won’t
      ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead
      of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don’t some of ye burst a
      blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an anchor overboard—we don’t
      budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s grass growing in the
      boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s budding. This won’t
      do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye
      spit fire or not?”
     
    
      “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What
      a hump—Oh, do pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads,
      do spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked
      clams and muffins—oh, do, do, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t
      lose him now—don’t oh, don’t!—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t
      ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye
      love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a
      whole bank! The bank of England!—Oh, do, do, do!—What’s that
      Yarman about now?”
     
    
      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
      retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically accelerating
      his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
    
    
      “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for
      the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
     
    
      “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
    
    
      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,
      occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, “There
      she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!
      Sail over him!”
     
    
      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their
      gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a
      righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of
      his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his
      white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing,
      and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that was a good
      time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal
      start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s quarter. An
      instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale’s
      immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming
      swell that he made.
    
    
      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
      going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented
      jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to
      this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
      every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways
      rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with
      clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving
      to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with
      plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb
      brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
      save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the
      sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,
      portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the
      stoutest man who so pitied.
    
    
      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s boats
      the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to
      hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the
      last chance would for ever escape.
    
    
      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
      tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to
      their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
      rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and his
      baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
      keels.
    
    
      “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
      upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—I
      saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
      sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury
      on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him
      that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
      hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going to Davy Jones—all
      a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the
      everlasting mail!”
     
    
      But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the
      loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so
      fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust
      the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated
      smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last—owing to the
      perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the
      three ropes went straight down into the blue—the gunwales of the
      bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high
      in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
      remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the
      position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and
      lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this
      hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is
      that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp
      lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
      doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
      to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more
      he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him—in a
      full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet—the
      pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing
      atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,
      in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a
      column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight
      of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
      twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
      board.
    
    
      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into
      its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,
      not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
      would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the
      utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight
      inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible
      that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the
      big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of
      board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said—“Canst
      thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The
      sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the
      habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;
      darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This
      the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
      For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
      his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s
      fish-spears!
    
    
      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
      down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to
      shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale
      must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
    
    
      “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
      scared from it into the sea.
    
    
      “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
     
    
      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship’s
      lengths of the hunters.
    
    
      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
      there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
      when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
      certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it
      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that
      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at
      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by
      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,
      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is
      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable
      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the
      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and
      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from
      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,
      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
      significantly call it, was untouched.
    
    
      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
      form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
      His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
      strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when
      prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes had once occupied,
      now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was
      none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must
      die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other
      merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that
      preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his
      blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or
      protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
    
    
      “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
     
    
      “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
     
    
      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous
      jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable
      anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly
      darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over
      with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring the bows. It was
      his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,
      that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on
      his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over
      slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his
      belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring
      spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
      mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
      spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying
      spout of the whale.
    
    
      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
      by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
      that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
      few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the
      ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly
      secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless
      artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
    
    
      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the
      entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on
      the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
      harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with
      the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to
      denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other
      unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration
      alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone
      being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm
      about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been
      darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before America was discovered.
    
    
      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
      there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by
      the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing
      to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,
      who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it
      so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been
      capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when
      the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
      strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were
      fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in
      the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like
      walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.
      Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from
      their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows
      were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift
      from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the
      submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole
      tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed
      on the point of going over.
    
    
      “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in such a
      devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for
      it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of
      ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.”
     
    
      “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at
      the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,
      when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every
      fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
    
    
      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
      is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted
      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its
      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales
      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might
      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon
      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of
      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest
      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the
      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
      these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
    
    
      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his
      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,
      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again
      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases
      are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort
      of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
      In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
      Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
      of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for
      it when it shall have ascended again.
    
    
      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
      the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
      her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
      belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible
      power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is so similar to the
      Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
      And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this
      unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young
      keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,
      hopeful chase.
    
    
      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
    
    
      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
      method.
    
    
      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to
      the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great
      honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great
      demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have
      shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I
      myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.
    
    
      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the
      eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by
      our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the
      knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the
      distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine
      story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of
      a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the
      very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly
      advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It
      was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers
      of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
      dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa,
      now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood
      for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and
      all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that
      Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to
      Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in
      this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
    
    
      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some
      supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of
      St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;
      for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled
      together, and often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the
      waters, and as a dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly
      meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word
      itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had
      St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of
      doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake,
      but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to
      march boldly up to a whale.
    
    
      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on
      land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of
      those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists; and
      considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with
      the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this
      so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,
      placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare
      like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name;
      who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s head and both the
      palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
      him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is
      the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of
      Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And
      therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of whom, I
      venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron),
      let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen
      frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George’s
      decoration than they.
    
    
      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained
      dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique
      Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds,
      was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly
      makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he
      ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.
      Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate
      the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our
      clan.
    
    
      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules
      and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient
      Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versÃ¢; certainly they are
      very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet?
    
    
      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
      kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
      short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to
      be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of
      the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine
      Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
      earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.
      When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate
      the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to
      Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
      perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning
      the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the
      shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at
      the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and
      sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.
      Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is
      called a horseman?
    
    
      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a member-roll
      for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like that?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
    
    
      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
      preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical
      story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
      and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,
      equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the
      dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
      traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
    
    
      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
      story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
      Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true
      with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying,
      “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to
      this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,
      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly,
      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems
      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth
      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
      players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow
      tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.
    
    
      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want
      of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead
      whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been
      divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown
      overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to
      another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I
      would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays
      christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been
      wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the
      book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which
      the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor
      Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another
      reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was
      swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he
      was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on
      the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across from the
      nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?
    
    
      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
      short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way
      of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the
      whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf
      and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
      circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
      waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim
      in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so
      early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland
      from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history
      a liar.
    
    
      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish
      pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that
      he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and
      the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable,
      devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese
      Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh via the Cape
      of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general
      miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks
      devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three
      centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s Voyages, speaks of a
      Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous
      lamp that burnt without any oil.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
    
    
      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed;
      and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation
      upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as
      such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible
      advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a
      sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide
      bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning
      not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than
      customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it
      hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently
      seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to
      be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain
      unwarranted by the event.
    
    
      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,
      as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
    
    
      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.
      What then remained?
    
    
      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
      none exceed that fine manÅuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is
      only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and
      feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately
      darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.
      Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in
      length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
      lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a
      warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand
      after darting.
    
    
      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the
      harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom
      done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of
      the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the
      lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,
      therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling
      comes into play.
    
    
      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in
      pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
      Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length
      to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of
      the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving
      the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband’s
      middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily
      depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the
      weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He
      minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next
      moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright
      steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the
      whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
    
    
      “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans
      whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad,
      I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink round it! Yea,
      verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the spread of his
      spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.”
     
    
      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the
      spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The
      agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the
      pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the
      monster die.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
    
    
      That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of
      ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the
      sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
      many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,
      watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be,
      and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes
      past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it
      should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,
      really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy
      thing.
    
    
      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,
      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined
      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to
      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human
      being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the
      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the
      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight
      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and
      this is on the top of his head.
    
    
      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable
      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,
      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to
      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I
      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it
      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,
      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a
      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who
      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling
      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between
      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when
      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So
      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a
      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and
      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as
      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising
      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time
      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then
      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his
      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,
      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,
      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
      whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not
      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a
      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
    
    
      In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving
      for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
    
    
      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
      it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I
      opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
      obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to
      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two
      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But
      owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it
      be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this
      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
      olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
      Cologne-water in the sea.
    
    
      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
      canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is
      furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
      retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has
      no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely
      rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to
      say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
      this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
    
    
      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for
      the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just
      beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this
      curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side
      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a
      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the
      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed
      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It
      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;
      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm
      Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
      between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
    
    
      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You
      have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell
      water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle
      these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of
      all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be
      undecided as to what it is precisely.
    
    
      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,
      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around
      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops
      of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely
      condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
      identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is
      countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For even when tranquilly
      swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump
      sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then, the whale always
      carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you
      will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
    
    
      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often
      happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing
      so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with
      the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I
      cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among
      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet
      is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the
      investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout
      alone.
    
    
      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other
      reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the
      great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no
      common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is
      never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
      He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads
      of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,
      Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible
      steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a
      little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
      me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
      undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my
      hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
      shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for
      the above supposition.
    
    
      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
      contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,
      d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.
      And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine
      intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And
      for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or
      denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
      earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
      neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with
      equal eye.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
    
    
      Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and
      the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I
      celebrate a tail.
    
    
      Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of
      the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon
      its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The
      compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or
      flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the
      crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede
      from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living
      thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the
      crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full
      grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.
    
    
      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into
      it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and
      horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise
      between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything
      else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the
      middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles
      always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the
      antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of
      the masonry.
    
    
      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the
      whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular
      fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running
      down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute
      to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the
      whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to
      matter, this were the thing to do it.
    
    
      Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
      graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates
      through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their
      most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,
      strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that
      all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its
      charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
      naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
      man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God
      the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they
      may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
      hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
      successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
      brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one
      of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the
      peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.
    
    
      Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
      wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be
      in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no
      fairy’s arm can transcend it.
    
    
      Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
      progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
      Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
    
    
      First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a
      different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
      wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
      whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
      which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
      furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
    
    
      Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights
      another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts
      with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a
      boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only
      inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially
      if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs
      of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it;
      but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to
      the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials,
      a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
      generally the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often
      received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some
      one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
    
    
      Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the
      sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a
      delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant’s trunk.
      This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in
      maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his
      immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he
      feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What
      tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail any
      prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes’ elephant
      that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented
      nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than
      one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue
      in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
      in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.
    
    
      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of
      his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great
      gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor
      from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was
      the smoke from the touch-hole.
    
    
      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie
      considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of
      sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps,
      his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect
      in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot
      out of view. Excepting the sublime breach—somewhere else to be
      described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the grandest
      sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
      profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
      highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth
      his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing
      at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean,
      the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.
      Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky
      and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading
      towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.
      As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of
      the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire
      worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I
      then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
      beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity
      often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest
      silence.
    
    
      The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant,
      so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other
      are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an
      equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For
      as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with
      Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful
      blow from the elephant’s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared
      with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous
      flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire
      boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian
      juggler tosses his balls.*
    
    
      *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
      the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant
      stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the
      elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
      similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant
      will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet
      it forth in a stream.
    
    
      The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability
      to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would
      well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive
      herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have
      heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;
      that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the
      world. Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general
      body, full of strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced
      assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him
      not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
      understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has
      none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face
      shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and
      hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
    
    
      The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
      the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In
      a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra,
      Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or
      rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long
      unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.
      This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of
      ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and
      Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the
      west, emerge into the China seas.
    
    
      Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
      midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
      promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to
      the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering
      the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and
      ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched,
      it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the
      very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however
      ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The
      shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering
      fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and
      the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
      obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
      ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have
      passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the
      costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial
      like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.
    
    
      Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low
      shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels
      sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of
      their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have
      received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs
      has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we
      occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in those waters,
      have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
    
    
      With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
      Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence,
      cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by
      the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far
      coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these
      means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm
      Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line
      in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit,
      firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most
      known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be
      presumed to be haunting it.
    
    
      But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
      drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the
      circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no
      sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler.
      While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to
      foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but
      herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake’s
      contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not
      altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years’ water
      in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
      the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
      fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
      streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from
      New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in
      all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having
      seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry
      them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well,
      boys, here’s the ark!”
     
    
      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,
      in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the
      ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more
      upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to
      keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed
      on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was
      snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing
      all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh
      entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,
      and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.
    
    
      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
      of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
      instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
      former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
      embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous
      nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance
      and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense
      caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising
      grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without
      being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
      sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
    
    
      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
      drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the
      Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising
      and falling away to leeward.
    
    
      Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the
      sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,
      and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the
      thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy
      autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
    
    
      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
      even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
      the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
      swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
    
    
      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
      their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended
      boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through
      these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental
      seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could
      tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not
      temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the
      coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on
      stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a
      sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to
      something in our wake.
    
    
      Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
      It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something
      like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
      go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling
      his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying,
      “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;—Malays,
      sir, and after us!”
     
    
      As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly
      have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit,
      to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with
      a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these
      tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen
      pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As
      with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn
      beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty
      pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he
      glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was
      then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
      his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both
      chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd
      of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally
      cheering him on with their curses;—when all these conceits had
      passed through his brain, Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the
      black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being
      able to drag the firm thing from its place.
    
    
      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
      after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at
      last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging
      at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to
      grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to
      rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But
      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating
      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,
      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by
      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
      the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their
      rear,—than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
      battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked
      bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
    
    
      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after
      several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a
      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert
      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say
      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto
      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;
      and like King Porus’ elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast
      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their
      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.
      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,
      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged
      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of
      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could
      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding
      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have
      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when
      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit, they will, at the
      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before
      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
    
    
      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet
      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
      Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in
      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for
      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale
      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed
      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the
      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags
      you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect
      life and only exist in a delirious throb.
    
    
      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the
      crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a
      ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their
      complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be
      locked in and crushed.
    
    
      But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from
      this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from
      that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,
      Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way
      whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to
      make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty
      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting
      part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried one, to a great
      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant
      threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail, there!” cried a second
      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself
      with his own fan-like extremity.
    
    
      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by
      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal
      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other’s grain
      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the
      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can
      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales
      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than
      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day
      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you
      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these
      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of
      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales
      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of
      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and
      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the
      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in
      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
      boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came
      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts
      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
    
    
      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not
      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly diminished;
      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference
      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last
      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;
      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between
      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain
      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the
      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In
      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,
      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in
      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they
      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted
      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw
      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and
      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder
      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density
      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed
      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall
      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of
      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the
      women and children of this routed host.
    
    
      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any
      one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the
      whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.
      At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be
      deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked
      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had
      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;
      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales—now
      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced
      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic
      which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came
      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it
      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg
      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but
      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.
    
    
      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in
      those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly
      and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives
      at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
      spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so did
      the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
      we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
      sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
      infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He
      was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
      from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
      reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the
      unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow. The delicate side-fins, and
      the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
      appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.
    
    
      “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him
      fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one
      little!”
     
    
      “What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.
    
    
      “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.
    
    
      As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
      fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
      the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
      air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame
      Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not
      seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the
      maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub
      is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed
      divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in
      the deep.*
    
    
      *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
      most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation
      which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
      time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and
      Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
      curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
      themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts
      in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring
      milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very
      sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with
      strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more
      hominum.
    
    
      And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
      affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
      fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in
      dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my
      being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and
      while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
      deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
    
    
      Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
      spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still
      engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly
      carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and
      some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged
      drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,
      was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when
      fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to
      hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic
      tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which
      is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we
      afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had
      broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon
      line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing
      among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
      battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
    
    
      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire
      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening
      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the
      unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in
      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the
      cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that
      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his
      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that
      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently
      flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
      wounding and murdering his own comrades.
    
    
      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary
      fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a
      little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows
      from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the
      submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more
      contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in
      thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum
      was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when
      the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came
      tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one
      common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
      taking the stern.
    
    
      “Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your
      oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
      you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand
      up—stand up, and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind
      their backs—scrape them!—scrape away!”
     
    
      The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
      narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
      we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at
      the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar
      hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been
      one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently
      making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the
      loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the
      fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy
      made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
    
    
      Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
      resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped
      together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight
      with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still
      lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped
      astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The
      waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;
      and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the
      floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also
      as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw
      near.
    
    
      The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
      saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the
      drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the
      time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft
      than the Pequod.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
    
    
      The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
      Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
      vast aggregations.
    
    
      Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have
      been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally
      observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are
      known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost
      entirely of females, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or
      bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
    
    
      In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
      male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
      his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
      ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
      over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
      endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
      concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
      leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
      than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
      comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
      yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
      whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point.
    
    
      It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
      ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
      search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower
      of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from
      spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
      unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down
      the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in
      anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive
      temperature of the year.
    
    
      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
      interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming
      that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies, with
      what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High
      times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to
      invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the Bashaw will, he
      cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed; for, alas! all
      fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the most terrible
      duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes
      come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower
      jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
      like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured
      having the deep scars of these encounters,—furrowed heads, broken
      teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated
      mouths.
    
    
      But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the
      first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that
      lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there
      awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious
      Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other
      whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of
      these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength,
      and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters
      they beget, why, those sons and daughters must take care of themselves; at
      least, with only the maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous
      roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the
      nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he
      leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In
      good time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
      dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
      general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue
      supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent,
      repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and
      grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the
      meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young
      Leviathan from his amorous errors.
    
    
      Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the
      lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It
      is therefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that
      after going to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not
      what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would
      very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,
      but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of
      Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself
      what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his
      younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he
      inculcated into some of his pupils.
    
    
      The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
      betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales.
      Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is called—proves
      an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no
      one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the
      wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so
      many moody secrets.
    
    
      The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
      mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those
      female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
      forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of
      all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
      excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and
      these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
    
    
      The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
      mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
      tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
      prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad
      at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when
      about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of
      settlements, that is, harems.
    
    
      Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still
      more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor
      devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school,
      and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes
      lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
    
    
      The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
      necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
      fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
    
    
      It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a
      whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and
      captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor
      contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after
      a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose
      from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to
      leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it
      alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and
      violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not
      some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
      cases.
    
    
      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,
      was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695.
      But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the
      American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this
      matter. They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness
      surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for
      the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s Business. Yes; these laws
      might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon,
      and worn round the neck, so small are they.
    
    
      I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
    
    
      II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
    
    
      But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
      brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound
      it.
    
    
      First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when
      it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
      controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a
      nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
      same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
      other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
      plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as
      their intention so to do.
    
    
      These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
      themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
      Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
      honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
      it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
      possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
      others are by no means so scrupulous.
    
    
      Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in
      England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a
      whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
      succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
      their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
      itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with
      the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the
      very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated
      with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’ teeth, and
      assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now
      retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the
      whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for
      the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.
    
    
      Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
      judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
      illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein
      a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s viciousness, had at
      last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years,
      repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of
      her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,
      that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once
      had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging
      viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that
      she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman
      re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman’s
      property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in
      her.
    
    
      Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale
      and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
    
    
      These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
      learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he
      awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save
      their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and
      line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a
      Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line
      because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a
      property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish
      had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo,
      the aforesaid articles were theirs.
    
    
      A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
      possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter,
      the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously
      quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited
      case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on
      reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for
      notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the
      Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.
    
    
      Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
      that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
      possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
      Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is
      the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s last
      mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble mansion
      with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the
      ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the
      bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from starvation; what is
      that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of
      Savesoul’s income of Â£100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
      hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
      without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular Â£100,000 but a
      Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary towns and hamlets but
      Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland,
      but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas
      but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not Possession the whole of
      the law?
    
    
      But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
      kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
      internationally and universally applicable.
    
    
      What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
      Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?
      What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to
      England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.
    
    
      What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish?
      What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of
      religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious
      smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is
      the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a
      Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
    
    
      “De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.” Bracton,
      l. 3, c. 3.
    
    
      Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
      context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
      that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
      and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
      in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate
      remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force
      in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
      touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in
      a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the
      English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially
      reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious
      proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I
      proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two
      years.
    
    
      It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of
      the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching
      a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.
      Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a
      sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office
      directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to
      the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this
      office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily
      employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by
      virtue of that same fobbing of them.
    
    
      Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
      trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
      fish high and dry, promising themselves a good Â£150 from the precious oil
      and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale
      with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps
      a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of
      Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands
      off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord
      Warden’s.” Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so
      truly English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching
      their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
      stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
      hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length
      one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to
      speak,
    
    
      “Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”
     
    
      “The Duke.”
     
    
      “But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
     
    
      “It is his.”
     
    
      “We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
      that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains
      but our blisters?”
     
    
      “It is his.”
     
    
      “Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
      getting a livelihood?”
     
    
      “It is his.”
     
    
      “I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this
      whale.”
     
    
      “It is his.”
     
    
      “Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
     
    
      “It is his.”
     
    
      In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
      Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
      lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
      deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of
      the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take
      the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which
      my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published) that he
      had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the
      reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would
      decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this the still militant
      old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands
      coercing alms of beggars?
    
    
      It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to
      the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire
      then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that
      right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the
      reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and
      Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the soundest
      commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.
    
    
      But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
      for that, ye lawyers!
    
    
      In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench
      author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s, that
      ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this was
      written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right
      whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is not in
      the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
      like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An
      allegorical meaning may lurk here.
    
    
      There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the
      whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
      nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I
      know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference
      it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the
      whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to
      that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously
      grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in
      all things, even in law.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
    
    
      “In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
      insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” Sir T. Browne, V.E.
    
    
      It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
      were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many
      noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three
      pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in
      the sea.
    
    
      “I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
      some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
      would keel up before long.”
     
    
      Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
      lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
      alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
      his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and
      hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
      must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has
      died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It
      may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;
      worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent
      to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that
      no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there
      those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained
      from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the
      nature of attar-of-rose.
    
    
      Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
      had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a
      nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
      problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious
      dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely
      bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall
      see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale
      as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.
    
    
      The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
      recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted
      round the tail of one of these whales.
    
    
      “There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the
      ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of
      Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their
      boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and
      sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow
      candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get
      won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all know these
      things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
      the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the
      dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,
      pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a present of a little oil
      for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale
      there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And
      as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and
      trying out these three masts of ours, than he’ll get from that bundle of
      bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a
      good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has
      thought of that. It’s worth trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he
      started for the quarter-deck.
    
    
      By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or
      no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
      escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
      now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
      across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French
      taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
      huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes
      projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical
      folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt
      letters, he read “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and
      this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.
    
    
      Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet
      the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently
      explained the whole to him.
    
    
      “A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will do
      very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
     
    
      Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had
      to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the
      blasted whale; and so talk over it.
    
    
      Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose,
      ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?”
     
    
      “Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the
      chief-mate.
    
    
      “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      “What whale?”
     
    
      “The White Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
    
    
      “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
     
    
      “Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”
     
    
      Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over
      the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a
      trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab retired, and
      Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
    
    
      He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
      and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.
    
    
      “What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
     
    
      “I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
      the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.
      “But what are you holding yours for?”
     
    
      “Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t it?
      Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
      Bouton-de-Rose?”
     
    
      “What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
      flying into a sudden passion.
    
    
      “Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those
      whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
      you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
      such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his
      whole carcase.”
     
    
      “I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
      it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
      come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll get
      out of this dirty scrape.”
     
    
      “Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb, and
      with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
      itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
      heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and
      talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses
      upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then
      pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get
      some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in
      coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken
      the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
      puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.
    
    
      Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the
      Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery
      face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This
      was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the
      proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain’s round-house
      (cabinet he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help
      yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.
    
    
      Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
      Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
      expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had
      brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him
      carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the
      slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace
      on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so
      that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and
      satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their
      sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,
      under cover of an interpreter’s office, was to tell the Captain what he
      pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any
      nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
    
    
      By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small
      and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large
      whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with
      watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
      introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
      aspect of interpreting between them.
    
    
      “What shall I say to him first?” said he.
    
    
      “Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
      may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
      though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”
     
    
      “He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
      captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and
      chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
      blasted whale they had brought alongside.”
     
    
      Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
    
    
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
    
    
      “Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
      carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a whale-ship
      than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a baboon.”
     
    
      “He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
      far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,
      as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
     
    
      Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew
      to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the
      cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
    
    
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.
    
    
      “Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in
      fact, tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
      else.”
     
    
      “He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to
      us.”
     
    
      Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
      (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his
      cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
    
    
      “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.
    
    
      “Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink with
      the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
     
    
      “He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking; but
      that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
      best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
      it’s so calm they won’t drift.”
     
    
      By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
      the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
      boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
      whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s boats, then,
      were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at
      his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long
      tow-line.
    
    
      Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
      hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
      Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
      pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his
      intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
      cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the
      body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
      digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
      against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery
      buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew were all in high excitement,
      eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
    
    
      And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,
      and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look
      disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly
      from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of
      perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being
      absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another,
      without at all blending with it for a time.
    
    
      “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
      the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
     
    
      Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
      something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese;
      very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb;
      it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is
      ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls
      were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more,
      perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab’s loud
      command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid
      them good bye.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
    
    
      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin
      was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.
      For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise
      origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.
      Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet
      the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on
      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris
      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,
      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,
      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,
      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it
      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s
      in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
    
    
      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
      themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale!
      Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by
      others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a
      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat
      loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of harm’s way, as
      laborers do in blasting rocks.
    
    
      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
      hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors’ 
      trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more
      than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
    
    
      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found
      in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying
      of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we
      are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that
      saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also
      forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,
      Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.
    
    
      I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,
      owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and
      which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered
      as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman’s two
      whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been
      disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy
      business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales
      always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?
    
    
      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in
      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it
      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and
      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any
      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and
      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is
      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city
      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.
    
    
      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,
      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place
      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being
      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,
      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation
      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite
      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years
      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,
      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that
      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or
      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of
      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor
      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a
      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;
      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,
      that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,
      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then
      shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?
      Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent
      with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander
      the Great?
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
    
    
      It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
      significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew; an
      event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly
      merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy
      of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
    
    
      Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
      few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
      the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
      these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats’ 
      crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
      wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was
      so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by
      abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his
      tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
    
    
      In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
      white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
      one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
      torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
      very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his
      tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,
      freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year’s calendar should
      show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New
      Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
      brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous
      ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life’s
      peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had
      somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
      brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
      subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange
      wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural
      lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once
      enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on the green; and at melodious
      even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one
      star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended
      against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful
      glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its
      most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then
      lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out
      those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,
      once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
      stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
    
    
      It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,
      temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
    
    
      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but
      happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
      therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
      him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to
      the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
    
    
      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
      fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,
      in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The involuntary
      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the
      boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against
      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in
      it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale
      started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor
      Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged
      there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and
      neck.
    
    
      Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated
      Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended
      its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed
      interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked,
      Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,
      this entire thing happened.
    
    
      “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
      saved.
    
    
      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
      yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular
      cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still
      half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially
      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,
      Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice
      ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in
      whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still
      better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give
      undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
      margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and
      concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the
      Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can’t afford to lose
      whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you
      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any more.”
       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,
      yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes
      with his benevolence.
    
    
      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
      under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time
      he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,
      Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas!
      Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue
      day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all
      round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin hammered out to the
      extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s ebon head showed like a
      head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.
      Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In
      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.
      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black
      head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the
      brightest.
    
    
      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
      lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
      middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
      when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely
      they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
    
    
      But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
      did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and
      he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
      quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
      oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested
      by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
      unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called,
      is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies
      and armies.
    
    
      But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying
      whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb’s boat
      was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that
      Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest
      chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little
      negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The
      sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his
      soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous
      depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and
      fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
      hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
      Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the
      firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the
      treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him
      mad. So man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal
      reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent
      as his God.
    
    
      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
      fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
      like abandonment befell myself.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
    
    
      That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
      Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously
      detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the
      Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
    
    
      While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
      dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when
      the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere
      going to the try-works, of which anon.
    
    
      It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several
      others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I found it
      strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid
      part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet
      and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a
      favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener!
      such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for only a few
      minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine
      and spiralise.
    
    
      As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
      exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
      indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among
      those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within
      the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their
      opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
      uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
      violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow;
      I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I
      washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old
      Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat
      of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all
      ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.
    
    
      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
      till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange
      sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my
      co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.
      Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this
      avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and
      looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,—Oh! my
      dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or
      know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all
      round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze
      ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
    
    
      Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
      many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases
      man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable
      felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in
      the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the
      country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case
      eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of
      angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
    
    
      Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin
      to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.
    
    
      First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
      part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is
      tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still
      contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is
      first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much
      like blocks of Berkshire marble.
    
    
      Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
      whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
      often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a
      most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
      imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
      snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
      purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it
      is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole
      behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a
      royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing
      him to have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that
      particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of
      the vineyards of Champagne.
    
    
      There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the
      course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
      adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original
      with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance. It is an
      ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of
      sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to
      be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.
    
    
      Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
      sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
      dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland
      or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls
      who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
    
    
      Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s vocabulary.
      But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s nipper is a short
      firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan’s
      tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the
      size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it
      operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of
      magic, allures along with it all impurities.
    
    
      But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once
      to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
      This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
      blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper
      time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
      terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull
      lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in
      pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is
      similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is
      something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet
      of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and
      lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,
      perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is
      sharp as hone can make it; the spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he
      stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.
      If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you
      be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
    
    
      Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
      post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
      windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
      curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
      there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
      cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
      jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
      surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer
      than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
      jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is;
      or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in
      the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which,
      King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it
      for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th
      chapter of the First Book of Kings.
    
    
      Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted
      by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,
      and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
      carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle
      deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African
      hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a
      pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its
      diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere
      long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the
      pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other
      end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands
      before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to
      all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while
      employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
    
    
      That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots;
      an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise
      against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the
      minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator’s desk. Arrayed
      in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves;
      what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this
      mincer!*
    
    
      *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to
      the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin
      slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out
      the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased,
      besides perhaps improving it in quality.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
    
    
      Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished
      by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
      masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It
      is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.
    
    
      The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
      roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
      fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar,
      some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not
      penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by
      ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to
      the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely
      covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we
      expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels’ 
      capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they
      are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
      punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl
      into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in
      polishing them—one man in each pot, side by side—many
      confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a
      place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand
      try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,
      that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in
      geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example,
      will descend from any point in precisely the same time.
    
    
      Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry
      of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the
      furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy
      doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented from
      communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
      extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
      inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
      fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
      from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
    
    
      It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were first
      started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the
      business.
    
    
      “All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
      works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his
      shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in
      a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time
      with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition
      to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,
      shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
      considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.
      Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once
      ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would
      that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and
      inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the
      time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk
      in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day
      of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.
    
    
      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
      darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
      flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
      illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.
      The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some
      vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold
      Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets
      of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them
      in conflagrations.
    
    
      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
      in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan
      harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge pronged poles they
      pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up
      the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors
      to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every
      pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all
      eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on
      the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served
      for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
      looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in
      their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat,
      their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their
      teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of
      the works. As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their
      tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter
      forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and
      fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge
      pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and
      the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all
      sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with
      fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness,
      seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s soul.
    
    
      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,
      in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the
      ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me,
      capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred
      visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
      drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.
    
    
      But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
      thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly
      conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side,
      which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just
      beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half
      conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching
      them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass
      before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been
      watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing
      seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of
      redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing
      I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
      havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.
      Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that
      the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is
      the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself
      about, and was fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the
      compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel
      from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad
      and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the
      night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
    
    
      Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
      hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint
      of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness
      makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies
      will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the
      morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,
      golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!
    
    
      Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
      accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
      deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which
      is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So,
      therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that
      mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With books the
      same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all
      books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.
      “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian
      Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks
      fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls
      Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and
      throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and
      therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones,
      and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.
    
    
      But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
      understanding shall remain” (i.e., even while living) “in the congregation
      of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee,
      deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but
      there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some
      souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of
      them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for
      ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even
      in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds
      upon the plain, even though they soar.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
    
    
      Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s forecastle,
      where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would
      have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of
      canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken
      vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon
      his hooded eyes.
    
    
      In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens.
      To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his
      pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of
      light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’s lamp, and
      lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull
      still houses an illumination.
    
    
      See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often
      but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at the
      try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns,
      too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated
      state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It
      is sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so
      as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on
      the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
    
    
      Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried
      from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and
      slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and
      beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to
      the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded surtout
      becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned
      to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti,
      oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;—but now it remains to
      conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing—singing,
      if I may—the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the
      casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan
      returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
      before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
    
    
      While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel
      casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and
      that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed
      over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery
      deck, like so many land slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in
      their course; and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can
      play upon them, for now, ex officio, every sailor is a cooper.
    
    
      At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
      hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down
      go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are
      replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
    
    
      In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents
      in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of
      blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale’s
      head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery
      yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the
      mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great
      leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.
    
    
      But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
      self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you
      would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most
      scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a
      singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look
      so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the
      ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and
      whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to
      the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the
      bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full
      tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous
      implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put
      away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works,
      completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are
      coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry
      of almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
      is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
      ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
      immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out
      the daintiest Holland.
    
    
      Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
      humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
      propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to
      taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such
      musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of
      audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring
      us napkins!
    
    
      But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on
      spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the
      old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere.
      Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors,
      which know no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours;
      when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day
      rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to carry vast chains,
      and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very
      sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the
      equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all
      this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make
      a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just
      buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of
      “There she blows!” and away they fly to fight another whale, and go
      through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is
      man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings
      extracted from this world’s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and
      then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and
      learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this
      done, when—There she blows!—the ghost is spouted up, and away
      we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life’s old routine
      again.
    
    
      Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
      thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee
      along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught
      thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
    
    
      Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
      taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
      the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added
      how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was
      wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the
      particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his
      glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot
      like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when
      resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same
      riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore
      the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild
      longing, if not hopefulness.
    
    
      But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
      attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though
      now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some
      monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain
      significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and
      the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the
      cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the
      Milky Way.
    
    
      Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
      heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
      head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the
      rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,
      untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito
      glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by
      ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
      darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every
      sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set
      apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their
      sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s
      talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,
      wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to
      spend it.
    
    
      Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and
      tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and
      stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in
      luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to
      derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through
      those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
    
    
      It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
      of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL
      ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
      middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
      and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows
      no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ 
      summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing
      cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the
      signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun
      entering the equinoctial point at Libra.
    
    
      Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
      pausing.
    
    
      “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all
      other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
      Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
      courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
      are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
      which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors
      back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask
      the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined
      sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the
      equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at
      Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, ’tis fit that
      man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here’s stout
      stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
     
    
      “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must have
      left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself,
      leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar’s
      awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below;
      let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks,
      that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this
      vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of
      Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes,
      the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun
      meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture;
      and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we
      gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
      sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
     
    
      “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
      been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
      faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And
      all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill
      or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph!
      in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen
      doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your
      doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia,
      your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and
      joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this
      doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me
      read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what
      old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below
      calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised
      with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of
      these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the
      book. Let’s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he’s always among
      ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they go—all alive:—Aries,
      or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the
      Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just
      crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.
      Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll
      do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
      thoughts. That’s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
      calendar, and Bowditch’s navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and
      wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant
      in wonders! There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By
      Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man
      in one round chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book.
      Come, Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog,
      he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing;
      then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach
      Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going
      from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few
      fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the
      Virgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,
      when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found
      wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump,
      as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the
      wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,
      is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the
      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and
      headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his
      whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we
      sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through
      it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he,
      aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does
      jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here
      comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let’s hear
      what he’ll have to say. There; he’s before it; he’ll out with something
      presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”
     
    
      “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a
      certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this
      staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at two
      cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t smoke dirty
      pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine hundred and sixty of
      them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
     
    
      “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
      foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
      wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old
      hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
      luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of
      the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he’s back
      again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice like an old
      worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
     
    
      “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the
      sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know their
      marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in
      Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign;
      for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what’s the horse-shoe sign?
      The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and devouring lion.
      Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
     
    
      “There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
      one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all
      tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
      Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
      thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
      suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back country.
      And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I
      guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make of
      the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s trowsers. But,
      aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of
      sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say,
      with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself;
      there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more
      and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would he had died, or I; he’s
      half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters—myself
      included—and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
      face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!”
     
    
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     
    
      “Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
      poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”
     
    
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     
    
      “Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
     
    
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
     
    
      “Well, that’s funny.”
     
    
      “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a crow,
      especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw!
      caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There he stands; two
      bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the
      sleeves of an old jacket.”
     
    
      “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could
      go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can
      stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my
      sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
     
    
      “Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to
      unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence? Then
      again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s nailed to the
      mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White
      Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland
      county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in
      it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they’ll
      say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find
      a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the
      gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser’ll hoard ye soon!
      Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and
      cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your
      hoe-cake done!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
    
    
      The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
    
    
      “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
      down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
      hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
      captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s bow. He was a
      darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
      thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
      festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
      behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.
    
    
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he
      held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like
      a mallet.
    
    
      “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
      him—“Stand by to lower!”
     
    
      In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew
      were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But
      here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
      moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
      once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
      always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
      the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel
      at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody—except
      those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen—to clamber up
      a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift
      the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it
      half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship
      of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now
      found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly
      eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
    
    
      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in
      the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two
      officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular
      ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of
      tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink
      them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea
      bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange
      captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I
      see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the
      cutting-tackle.”
     
    
      As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
      previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
      blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was
      quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
      solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the
      fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
      word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own
      weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the
      tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently
      landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in
      welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg,
      and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his
      walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm
      and a leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that
      never can run. Where did’st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”
     
    
      “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the
      East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope;
      “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
     
    
      “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the
      capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.
    
    
      “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
     
    
      “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
     
    
      “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began
      the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one
      day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to
      one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and
      milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all
      their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom
      of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all
      crows’ feet and wrinkles.”
     
    
      “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
      breath.
    
    
      “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye—they were mine—my irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but
      on!”
     
    
      “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well, this
      old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into
      the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
    
    
      “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old
      trick—I know him.”
     
    
      “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not know;
      but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;
      but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line,
      bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale’s; that
      went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a
      noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in
      my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he
      seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the
      tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat’s crew
      for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my
      first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop;
      Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into
      Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then;
      and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
      But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next
      instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all
      befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail looming
      straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No
      use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
      sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to
      toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my
      boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white
      hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck
      out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole
      sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a
      combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one
      good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed
      second iron towing along near me caught me here” (clapping his hand just
      below his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
      Hell’s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good
      God, the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole
      length of my arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and
      that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr.
      Bunger, ship’s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger
      boy, spin your part of the yarn.”
     
    
      The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
      time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
      gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
      one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
      trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
      marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
      occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
      crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab, he
      politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.
    
    
      “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my
      advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
     
    
      “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
      captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
     
    
      “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
      weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
      up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
     
    
      “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering
      his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn’t
      see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about
      three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and
      was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically
      severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don’t ye? You know
      you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I’d rather be
      killed by you than kept alive by any other man.”
     
    
      “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said
      the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is
      apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort.
      But I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I
      myself—that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am
      a strict total abstinence man; I never drink—”
     
    
      “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to
      him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on
      with the arm story.”
     
    
      “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
      sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my best
      and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth
      was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two
      feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short,
      it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no
      hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing
      at it with the marlingspike—“that is the captain’s work, not mine;
      he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to
      the end, to knock some one’s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
      once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,
      sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a
      bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry
      trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“Well, the captain
      there will tell you how that came here; he knows.”
     
    
      “No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it.
      Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
      Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
      pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
     
    
      “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
      impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
    
    
      “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
      didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn’t
      then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some
      time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as
      some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
     
    
      “Did’st thou cross his wake again?”
     
    
      “Twice.”
     
    
      “But could not fasten?”
     
    
      “Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without
      this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he
      swallows.”
     
    
      “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to get
      the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
      bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that
      the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
      Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even
      a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White
      Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a
      single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like
      the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making
      believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in
      good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave
      him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d’ye see. No possible
      way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his
      general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about
      it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of
      giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only
      let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”
     
    
      “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the arm
      he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to
      another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once, and
      that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know
      that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
      he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the
      ivory leg.
    
    
      “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone,
      that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a magnet!
      How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”
     
    
      “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly
      walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s blood—bring
      the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
      these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and
      drawing near to Ahab’s arm.
    
    
      “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the
      boat! Which way heading?”
     
    
      “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
      “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain
      crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
    
    
      But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take
      the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards
      him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.
    
    
      In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men were
      springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back
      to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood
      upright till alongside of the Pequod.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
    
    
      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant
      of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp;
      Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not far behind
      the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real
      historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this
      great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not
      make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships
      that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years
      previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and
      the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the
      North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,
      that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with
      civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they
      were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.
    
    
      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and
      at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and
      was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the
      great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to
      her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia’s example
      was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast
      Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with
      this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and
      all his Sons—how many, their mother only knows—and under their
      immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
      government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
      voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain,
      the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much
      does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a
      discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote
      waters of Japan. That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a
      noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling
      Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was
      commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
    
    
      All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
      the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have
      slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
    
    
      The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
      sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
      somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
      forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every
      soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam
      I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
      ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of
      that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I
      ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
      at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
      squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were
      called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
      other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
      jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling
      gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go
      overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass
      the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle
      scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.
    
    
      The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
      bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
      certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
      symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you
      could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If
      you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you
      like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be helped; besides,
      it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only fresh
      fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy
      to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking
      her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook’s boilers,
      including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel
      Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;
      crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.
    
    
      But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English
      whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable
      ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
      joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
      will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter
      for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical
      whale research, when it has seemed needed.
    
    
      The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
      Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in
      the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty
      to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship
      scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English,
      this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental
      and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is
      here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.
    
    
      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must
      be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I concluded that
      this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the
      fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in
      this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one “Fitz
      Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of
      Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott’s, to
      whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles
      for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the
      book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The Cooper,” but “The
      Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of
      the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very
      interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was,
      headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a long detailed list of the
      outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from
      which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
    
    
      400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
      fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of
      butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
      (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
      beer.
    
    
      Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the
      present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,
      barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
    
    
      At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
      beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
      incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
      application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own,
      touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low
      Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery.
      In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese
      consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous
      natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their
      vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid
      Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the
      convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.
    
    
      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
      polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
      climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
      including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much
      exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of
      180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have
      precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’ allowance,
      exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether
      these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have
      been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat’s head, and take
      good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they
      did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it
      remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the
      Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer
      sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might
      ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
    
    
      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers
      have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising
      in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a
      good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the decanter.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
    
    
      Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
      dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
      upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
      sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
      further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and
      casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones,
      set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional
      skeleton.
    
    
      But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,
      pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did
      erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy
      of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for
      exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on
      your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A
      veritable witness have you hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you
      seize the privilege of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the
      joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings,
      making up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
      dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.
    
    
      I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath
      the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an
      opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small
      cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag,
      to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the
      lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and
      jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that
      young cub?
    
    
      And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
      gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to
      my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For
      being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of
      Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the
      lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not
      very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
    
    
      Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
      with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together
      in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could
      invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells,
      inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed
      among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering
      waves had cast upon his shores.
    
    
      Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
      unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
      head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed
      his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its
      fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the
      skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand
      temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
    
    
      The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrÃ¦ were carved with
      Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
      kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
      sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific
      lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so
      affrighted Damocles.
    
    
      It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the
      trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious
      earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it,
      whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living
      flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the
      shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these
      unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun
      seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver!
      unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—whither flows the
      fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings?
      Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single word with thee!
      Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the loom;
      the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he
      weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice;
      and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only
      when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it.
      For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are
      inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard
      without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have
      villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all
      this din of the great world’s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be
      overheard afar.
    
    
      Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
      great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler!
      Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
      him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
      with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself
      a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived
      with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
    
    
      Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
      skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet
      had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object
      of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear
      that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton—brushed
      the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and with a ball of
      Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded
      colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I
      emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;
      naught was there but bones.
    
    
      Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.
      From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
      altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st thou measure
      this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long do ye
      make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
      feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with their yard-sticks—the
      great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly
      concluded my own admeasurements.
    
    
      These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
      recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
      measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer
      to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in
      Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where they have
      some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard
      that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the
      proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale
      in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton
      Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession
      the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the
      full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo’s.
    
    
      In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,
      were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King
      Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was
      lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford’s whale has been
      articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can
      open and shut him, in all his bony cavities—spread out his ribs like
      a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be
      put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show
      round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford
      thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the
      spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his
      cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.
    
    
      The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
      verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
      wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
      such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the
      other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
      composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did
      not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
      enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.
    
    
      In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
      statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
      are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
    
    
      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
      upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
      calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
      eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet
      in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety
      tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably
      outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one
      hundred inhabitants.
    
    
      Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
      leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?
    
    
      Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,
      teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply
      point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed
      bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of
      the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated
      part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you
      must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed,
      otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we
      are about to view.
    
    
      In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
      feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been
      ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in
      length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull
      and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain
      back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of
      its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his
      vitals.
    
    
      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
      extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the
      hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of
      her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time,
      but a long, disconnected timber.
    
    
      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly
      six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively
      longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle
      ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the
      remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet
      and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly
      correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In
      some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath
      bridges over small streams.
    
    
      In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the
      whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the
      Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
      which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the
      invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
      feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
      feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living
      magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked
      spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in
      flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here
      saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic,
      but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
    
    
      How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to
      comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
      attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the
      heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry
      flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
      be truly and livingly found out.
    
    
      But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane,
      to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it’s done,
      it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.
    
    
      There are forty and odd vertebrÃ¦ in all, which in the skeleton are not
      locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic
      spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one,
      is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four.
      The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two
      inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was
      told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost by some
      little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children, who had stolen them to
      play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of
      living things tapers off at last into simple child’s play.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.
    
    
      From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to
      enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
      compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
      folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the
      yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions
      of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers
      coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.
    
    
      Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
      approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking
      the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the
      uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him in most of his
      present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify
      him in an archÃ¦ological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.
      Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such
      portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when
      Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this
      emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said,
      that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
      dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson,
      expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s
      uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by
      a whale author like me.
    
    
      One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though
      it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this
      Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.
      Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an inkstand!
      Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this
      Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching
      comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the
      sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past,
      present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth,
      and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so
      magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its
      bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great
      and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
      who have tried it.
    
    
      Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials
      as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a
      stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,
      wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of
      preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier
      geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
      completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
      the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted
      links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
      posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto
      discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
      superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any
      known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them
      in general respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.
    
    
      Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
      and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
      found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in
      Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among
      the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year
      1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening
      almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in
      excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s time. Cuvier
      pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown
      Leviathanic species.
    
    
      But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
      complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on
      the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous
      slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.
      The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the
      name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the
      sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out that this alleged
      reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A significant
      illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the
      skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully
      invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his
      paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in
      substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of
      the globe have blotted out of existence.
    
    
      When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws,
      ribs, and vertebrÃ¦, all characterized by partial resemblances to the
      existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other
      hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their
      incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous
      period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with
      man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering
      glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed
      hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this
      world’s circumference, not an inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was
      visible. Then the whole world was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he
      left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who
      can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood
      than the Pharaoh’s. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake
      hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
      existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
      before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
    
    
      But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
      stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
      ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
      for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print
      of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty
      years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and
      painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins,
      similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.
      Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in
      that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.
    
    
      Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of
      the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the
      venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
    
    
      “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of
      which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
      oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that
      by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it
      without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either
      side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and
      wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a Whale’s Rib of an
      incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its
      convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached
      by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have
      layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that
      a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do
      not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at
      the Base of the Temple.”
     
    
      In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
      Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?
    
    
      Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the
      head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the
      long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original
      bulk of his sires.
    
    
      But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
      present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found
      in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to
      man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to
      its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.
    
    
      Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
      Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy
      feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the
      tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized
      modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority, that Sperm Whales
      have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.
    
    
      But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
      advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it
      not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?
    
    
      Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
      gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells
      us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others
      which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks and Thames
      Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke’s
      naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting
      down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one
      hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And
      LacÃ©pÃ¨de, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in
      the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one
      hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was
      published so late as A.D. 1825.
    
    
      But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as
      big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I,
      a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I
      cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were
      buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so
      much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the
      cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh
      tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as
      plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,
      not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh’s fat
      kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
      whale alone should have degenerated.
    
    
      But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
      recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
      at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through
      Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the
      world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental
      coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a
      chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be
      exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke
      his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
    
    
      Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
      which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
      of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
      their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
      where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a
      comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the
      hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
    
    
      But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period
      ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois
      exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
      not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
      cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
      different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
      end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
      forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if
      at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the
      old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far
      west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the
      same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on
      horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
      thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
      statistically stated.
    
    
      Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual
      extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the
      latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods,
      were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the
      voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.
      Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some
      views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large
      degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other
      days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.
      That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the
      so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
      abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are
      only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer
      enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand
      has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
    
    
      Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
      firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
      impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss
      have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades
      of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their
      Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls
      there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of
      everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
    
    
      But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
      cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
      positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But
      though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000,
      have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the Americans alone;
      yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little
      or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
    
    
      Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of
      the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto,
      the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of
      Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as
      droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to
      doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of
      years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive
      monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in great numbers,
      much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture
      to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both
      Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
      combined.
    
    
      Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
      whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore
      at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be
      contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by
      imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation
      yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were
      alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to the
      present human population of the globe.
    
    
      Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
      species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before
      the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries,
      and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he despised Noah’s
      Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,
      to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and
      rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed
      defiance to the skies.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.
    
    
      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his
      own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that
      his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after
      gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently
      wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever,
      something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already
      shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it
      still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem
      it entirely trustworthy.
    
    
      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
      been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he had
      been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some
      unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb
      having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and
      all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the
      agonizing wound was entirely cured.
    
    
      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the
      anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
      former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
      reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
      songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable
      events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought
      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the
      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an
      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all
      hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely
      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the
      deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest
      earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in
      them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some
      men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie
      the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the
      gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in
      the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
    
    
      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why
      it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing of
      the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like
      exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it
      were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg’s bruited reason
      for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching
      all Ahab’s deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant
      darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this
      one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his
      temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
      dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a
      less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted
      casualty—remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested
      itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and
      of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so
      far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others;
      and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did
      it transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.
    
    
      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or
      the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with
      earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
      practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.
    
    
      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
      set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
      with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus
      far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of
      the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the
      carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to
      provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the
      distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was ordered to be
      hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the
      affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
      whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
    
    
      Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
      abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
      from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
      seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
      But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the
      high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate; hence,
      he now comes in person on this stage.
    
    
      Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to
      whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike
      experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the
      carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those
      numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
      auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic
      remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in
      those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a
      large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in uncivilized and
      far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing
      stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars,
      inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks,
      and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
      business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
      conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.
    
    
      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
      except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
      athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
    
    
      A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the
      carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files
      it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is
      made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and
      cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
      cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a
      soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the
      blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the
      carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy
      to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has
      the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his
      bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces
      under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden
      vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have
      him draw the tooth.
    
    
      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and
      without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed
      but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now
      upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness
      of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon
      vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man
      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;
      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of
      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the
      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,
      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,
      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet
      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,
      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled
      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight
      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old
      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,
      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever
      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You
      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a
      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to
      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been
      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but
      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a
      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed
      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those
      unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield
      contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of
      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,
      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,
      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the
      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of
      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,
      and there they were.
    
    
      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was,
      after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common
      soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its
      duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of
      hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided
      for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
      unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a
      great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel,
      which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box
      and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep
      himself awake.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter.
    
    
      The Deck—First Night Watch.
    
    
      (Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
      lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly
      fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and
      various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame
      of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.)
    
    
      Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and
      that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
      shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (sneezes).
      Halloa, this bone dust is (sneezes)—why it’s (sneezes)—yes
      it’s (sneezes)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an
      old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
      don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get it (sneezes).
      Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s have that ferule
      and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (sneezes)
      there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere
      shinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to
      put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn
      him out as neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor.
      Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t
      compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and
      have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions, just like live
      legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and
      see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.
      Ha! that’s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else,
      that’s certain.
    
    
      AHAB (advancing). (During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
      sneezing at times.)
    
    
      Well, manmaker!
    
    
      Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let
      me measure, sir.
    
    
      Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it! There;
      keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter;
      let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
    
    
      Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!
    
    
      No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
      world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
      blacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?
    
    
      He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
    
    
      Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce
      red flame there!
    
    
      Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
    
    
      Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
      Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith,
      and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must properly belong
      to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the
      remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he’s through
      with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades;
      there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
    
    
      Sir?
    
    
      Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a
      desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
      modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay in
      one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass
      forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see—shall
      I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head
      to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
    
    
      Now, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like to
      know? Shall I keep standing here? (aside).
    
    
      ’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
      no, no; I must have a lantern.
    
    
      Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
    
    
      What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted
      light is worse than presented pistols.
    
    
      I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
    
    
      Carpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an
      extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or
      would’st thou rather work in clay?
    
    
      Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
    
    
      The fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
    
    
      Bone is rather dusty, sir.
    
    
      Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
      living people’s noses.
    
    
      Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!
    
    
      Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
      workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy
      work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless
      feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter,
      my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive
      that old Adam away?
    
    
      Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
      something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
      entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking
      him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
    
    
      It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;
      so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.
      Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,
      do I. Is’t a riddle?
    
    
      I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
    
    
      Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
      may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
      thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
      solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t speak!
      And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long
      dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of
      hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
    
    
      Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I
      think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.
    
    
      Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before
      the leg is done?
    
    
      Perhaps an hour, sir.
    
    
      Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here I
      am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a
      bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not
      do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I’m down in the whole
      world’s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the
      wealthiest PrÃ¦torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the
      world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
      heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one
      small, compendious vertebra. So.
    
    
      CARPENTER (resuming his work).
    
    
      Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he’s
      queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he’s queer,
      says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr.
      Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very
      queer. And here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his
      bedfellow! has a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his
      leg; he’ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in
      three places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was
      that? Oh! I don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
      strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.
      Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out
      into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you
      under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for life-boats. And
      here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks
      one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them
      mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old
      coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to
      death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the
      cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
      let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his
      horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old
      beer barrels, to fill ’em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a
      real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on
      this to-morrow; he’ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot
      the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
      So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
    
    
      According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
      inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
      sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the
      cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
    
    
      *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a
      regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the
      casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed
      by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight;
      while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners
      readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.
    
    
      Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
      the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the
      China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general
      chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another
      separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands—Niphon,
      Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the
      screwed leg of his table, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in
      his hand, the wondrous old man, with his back to the gangway door, was
      wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old courses again.
    
    
      “Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to
      it. “On deck! Begone!”
     
    
      “Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We
      must up Burtons and break out.”
     
    
      “Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
      for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
     
    
      “Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
      in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,
      sir.”
     
    
      “So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
     
    
      “I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”
     
    
      “And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!
      I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,
      but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far worse plight
      than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak; for who can find
      it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in this
      life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the Burtons hoisted.”
     
    
      “What will the owners say, sir?”
     
    
      “Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
      cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about
      those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye,
      the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my
      conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”
     
    
      “Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
      with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
      not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of
      itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; “A
      better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
      enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.”
     
    
      “Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
      deck!”
     
    
      “Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be
      forbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
      Captain Ahab?”
     
    
      Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
      South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
      exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain
      that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”
     
    
      For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you
      would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the
      levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he
      quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast outraged,
      not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck;
      thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself,
      old man.”
     
    
      “He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
       murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab
      beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using
      the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
      little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
      returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
    
    
      “Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate;
      then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
      close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and
      break out in the main-hold.”
     
    
      It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
      Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or
      mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade
      the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the
      important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were
      executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
    
    
      Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were
      perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm
      weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the
      huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those
      gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so
      ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,
      that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing
      coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning
      the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of
      water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of
      hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get
      about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over
      empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted
      demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all
      Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them
      then.
    
    
      Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
      bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to
      his endless end.
    
    
      Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
      dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher
      you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer,
      must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as we have
      elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally
      descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that
      subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and
      see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the
      holders, so called.
    
    
      Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have
      stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped
      to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that
      dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.
      And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,
      strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible
      chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days’ suffering,
      laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How
      he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there
      seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else
      in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,
      seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of
      lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a
      wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or
      be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter,
      expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of
      Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by
      the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as
      any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
      wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
      the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
      with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
      adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee
      or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious
      shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay
      in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to
      his final rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
      higher towards his destined heaven.
    
    
      Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
      he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He
      called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just
      breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced
      to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his
      native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died
      in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of
      being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of
      his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in
      his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;
      for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond
      all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with
      the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He
      added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
      according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
      death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket,
      all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat
      these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but
      uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.
    
    
      Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was
      at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might include.
      There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon
      a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the
      Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to
      be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking
      his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his
      character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg’s measure with
      great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s person as he shifted the
      rule.
    
    
      “Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island
      sailor.
    
    
      Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
      reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
      was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at
      its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to
      work.
    
    
      When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
      lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether
      they were ready for it yet in that direction.
    
    
      Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on
      deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s
      consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
      him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
      dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly
      trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.
    
    
      Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
      attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn
      from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of
      the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then
      ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the
      head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;
      and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now
      entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its
      comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told
      one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his
      arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch
      he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a
      leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his
      composed countenance in view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he
      murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
    
    
      But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
      while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by
      the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
    
    
      “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go
      ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the
      beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for
      me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think he’s in those
      far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad;
      for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig,
      dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your dying march.”
     
    
      “I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
      violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
      that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly
      forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their
      hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this
      strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our
      heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he speaks
      again: but more wildly now.”
     
    
      “Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his harpoon?
      Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
      now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye that;
      Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
      say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
      a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
      Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped
      from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
      him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all
      cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that jumped from
      a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
     
    
      During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was
      led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
    
    
      But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
      his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there
      seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed
      their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his
      sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he had just
      recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore
      had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They
      asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign
      will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg’s
      conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not
      kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
      unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
    
    
      Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
      that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally
      speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good
      time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the
      windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he
      suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a
      good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of
      his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a
      fight.
    
    
      With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
      emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many
      spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque
      figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his
      rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this
      tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,
      who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete
      theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of
      attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to
      unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even
      himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
      mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the
      living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
      last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild
      exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor
      Queequeg—“Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
    
    
      When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
      Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific
      with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was
      answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of
      blue.
    
    
      There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
      awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
      fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
      John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
      prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise
      and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades
      and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call
      lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in
      their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
    
    
      To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
      ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the
      world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves
      wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted
      by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts
      of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between float milky-ways
      of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and
      impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the
      world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the
      tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs
      must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
    
    
      But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
      statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril
      he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose
      sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously
      inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated
      White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at length upon these
      almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the
      old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a
      vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in
      his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, “Stern all!
      the White Whale spouts thick blood!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
    
    
      Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
      these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
      shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith,
      had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his
      contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast
      lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked
      by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for
      them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and
      boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all
      waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and
      lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.
      Nevertheless, this old man’s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient
      arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent,
      slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back,
      he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his
      hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.—Most
      miserable!
    
    
      A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
      yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
      curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
      questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
      one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
    
    
      Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
      running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the
      deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
      dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet.
      Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of
      the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of
      the grief of his life’s drama.
    
    
      He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
      encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been an
      artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and
      garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe,
      ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in
      a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in
      a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home,
      and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith
      himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family’s heart. It
      was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew
      the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and
      economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was in the basement of his
      dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young
      and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with
      vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’s
      hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and
      walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout
      Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s infants were rocked to slumber.
    
    
      Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst
      thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him,
      then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly
      venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of
      them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder
      brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of
      some other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till
      the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.
    
    
      Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
      and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the
      wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing
      into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked
      up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into the long
      church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the
      houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every
      woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!
    
    
      Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is
      only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the
      first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the
      Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men,
      who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide,
      does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth
      his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life
      adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand
      mermaids sing to them—“Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another
      life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders
      supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life
      which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more
      oblivious than death. Come hither! put up thy gravestone, too, within the
      churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!”
     
    
      Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall
      of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went
      a-whaling.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
    
    
      With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
      mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed
      upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and
      with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along,
      carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a
      little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,
      withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil—the
      red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which
      flew close to Ahab.
    
    
      “Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in
      thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
      burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”
     
    
      “Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting
      for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st thou
      scorch a scar.”
     
    
      “Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to
      me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is
      not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?
      How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,
      that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making there?”
     
    
      “Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
     
    
      “And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
      usage as it had?”
     
    
      “I think so, sir.”
     
    
      “And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind
      how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
     
    
      “Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
     
    
      “Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with
      both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—here—can ye
      smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
      ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
      head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer!
      Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”
     
    
      “Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
     
    
      “Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though
      thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of
      my skull—that is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s play; no more
      gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the leathern bag, as if it
      were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand
      yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale
      like his own fin-bone. There’s the stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the
      anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the
      steel shoes of racing horses.”
     
    
      “Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best
      and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”
     
    
      “I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
      melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
      first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these
      twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I’ll blow
      the fire.”
     
    
      When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
      spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
      flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”
     
    
      This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab
      stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with
      regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the
      glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up
      its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over
      his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on
      the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
    
    
      “What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered Stubb,
      looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and
      smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”
     
    
      At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
      Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
      by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.
    
    
      “Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain; “have
      I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”
     
    
      “Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
      harpoon for the White Whale?”
     
    
      “For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,
      man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the barbs
      sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
     
    
      For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
      not use them.
    
    
      “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
      nor pray till—but here—to work!”
     
    
      Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank,
      the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was
      about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried
      to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
    
    
      “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
      there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as
      much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster of dark
      nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the
      White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.
    
    
      “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!” deliriously
      howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal
      blood.
    
    
      Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,
      with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the
      iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it
      taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot
      upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending
      over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, “Good! and now for the
      seizings.”
     
    
      At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
      were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was
      then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was
      traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so, with
      intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
      Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
      the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
      both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,
      light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
      Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange
      mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy
      ship, and mocked it!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
    
    
      Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
      ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
      pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
      stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or
      paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes
      calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their
      pains.
    
    
      At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
      heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
      sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
      cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
      quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean’s
      skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not
      willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
    
    
      These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
      certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
      regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only
      the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high rolling
      waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when the
      western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden
      bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
    
    
      The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there
      steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie
      sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of
      the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so
      that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one
      seamless whole.
    
    
      Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
      temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to
      open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them
      prove but tarnishing.
    
    
      Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,—though
      long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye, men yet
      may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few
      fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to
      God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of
      life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for
      every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do
      not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:—through
      infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless faith, adolescence’ 
      doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last
      in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the
      round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies
      the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the
      world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling’s
      father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die
      in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we
      must there to learn it.
    
    
      And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
      same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
    
    
      “Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s eye!—Tell
      me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let
      faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.”
     
    
      And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden
      light:—
    
    
      “I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he
      has always been jolly!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
    
    
      And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
      before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.
    
    
      It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last
      cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad
      holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing
      round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing
      her prow for home.
    
    
      The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
      at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;
      and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
      last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were
      flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her
      three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her
      top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid;
      and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.
    
    
      As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
      success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas
      numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single
      fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room
      for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had
      been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along
      the deck, and in the captain’s and officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin
      table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined
      off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
      centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and
      pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the
      cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the
      steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the
      harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that
      indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons
      pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in
      self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.
    
    
      As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
      barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
      still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
      try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of
      the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
      hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were
      dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the
      Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
      aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with
      glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
      jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s company were tumultuously busy at the
      masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You
      would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
      wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being
      hurled into the sea.
    
    
      Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship’s
      elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before
      him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.
    
    
      And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with
      a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s wakes—one
      all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things
      to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole
      striking contrast of the scene.
    
    
      “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting a
      glass and a bottle in the air.
    
    
      “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.
    
    
      “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the other
      good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”
     
    
      “Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
     
    
      “Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come
      aboard, old hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow.
      Come along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
     
    
      “How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art a
      full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty
      ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!
      Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”
     
    
      And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
      stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of
      the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding
      Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for the lively
      revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
      homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
      then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote
      associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
    
    
      Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
      sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
      rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it
      with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales
      were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
    
    
      It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson
      fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and
      whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such
      plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that
      it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the
      Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone
      to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
    
    
      Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off
      from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
      tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
      dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that
      strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
      conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
    
    
      “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
      homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
      worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh
      that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look!
      here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most
      candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets;
      where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless
      and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the Niger’s unknown source;
      here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than
      death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way.
    
    
      “Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
      thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou
      art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
      wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
      has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
      again, without a lesson to me.
    
    
      “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed
      jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh
      whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only
      calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock
      me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float
      beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as
      air, but water now.
    
    
      “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl
      finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill
      and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
    
    
      The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
      windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last
      three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not
      be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side
      all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.
    
    
      The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and the
      lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the
      black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently
      chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
    
    
      Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
      in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
      whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like
      the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
      Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
    
    
      Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped
      round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded
      world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.
    
    
      “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin
      can be thine?”
     
    
      “And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
     
    
      “But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
      hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
      mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
      America.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes
      floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
      sight we shall not soon see.”
     
    
      “Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
     
    
      “And what was that saying about thyself?”
     
    
      “Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
     
    
      “And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere
      I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was
      it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here
      two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”
     
    
      “Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
      like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
     
    
      “The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,”
       cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
     
    
      Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
      slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale
      was brought to the ship.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
    
    
      The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
      coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
      ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
      the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on
      the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s prow for
      the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and
      Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his
      wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.
    
    
      Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
      effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus
      of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered;
      clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of
      unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God’s throne. Well
      that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to
      take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of
      the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye,
      he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant
      when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole
      attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s
      deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with
      him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face
      was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
      observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon
      calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling
      into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to
      himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly
      where I am—but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or
      canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living?
      Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of
      mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into
      the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
      thither side of thee, thou sun!”
     
    
      Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
      numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
      “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and
      Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what
      after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
      thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee:
      no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one
      grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou
      insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all
      the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness
      but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light,
      O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon are the glances of man’s
      eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze
      on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no
      longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and
      the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and
      show me my place on the sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck,
      “thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;
      thus I split and destroy thee!”
     
    
      As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead
      feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic
      despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute,
      motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while,
      awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together
      on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—“To
      the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
     
    
      In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her
      heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long,
      ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient
      steed.
    
    
      Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
      tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
    
    
      “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of
      its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,
      to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what
      will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”
     
    
      “Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck—sea-coal,
      not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, ‘Here some one
      thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play
      them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in
      the game, and die in it!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
    
    
      Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches
      in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket
      the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept
      tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese
      seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will
      sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a
      dazed and sleepy town.
    
    
      Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
      bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
      ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
      thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
      fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
      tempest had left for its after sport.
    
    
      Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every
      flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
      might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were
      directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.
      But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the
      cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did not escape. A great rolling
      sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship’s high teetering side, stove
      in the boat’s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through
      like a sieve.
    
    
      “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck, “but
      the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You see, Mr.
      Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round
      the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start
      I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never mind; it’s all
      in fun: so the old song says;”—(sings.)
    
  Oh! jolly is the gale,
  And a joker is the whale,
  A’ flourishin’ his tail,—
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  The scud all a flyin’,
  That’s his flip only foamin’;
  When he stirs in the spicin’,—
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  Thunder splits the ships,
  But he only smacks his lips,
  A tastin’ of this flip,—
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

    
      “Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp
      here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
      peace.”
     
    
      “But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
      and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck,
      there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And
      when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.”
     
    
      “Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
     
    
      “What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
      mind how foolish?”
     
    
      “Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
      hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes from
      the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very
      course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that
      stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
      stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
      must!
    
    
      “I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”
     
    
      “Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,”
       soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s question. “The gale
      that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that
      will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom;
      but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up there; but not with
      the lightning.”
     
    
      At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the
      flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a
      volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
    
    
      “Who’s there?”
     
    
      “Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
      pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
      lances of fire.
    
    
      Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the
      perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships
      carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this
      conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all
      contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there,
      it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with
      some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel’s way in the
      water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship’s lightning-rods are
      not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as
      to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down
      into the sea, as occasion may require.
    
    
      “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to
      vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to
      light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft.
      Quick!”
     
    
      “Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the weaker
      side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that
      all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir.”
     
    
      “Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”
     
    
      All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
      tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
      the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
      three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
    
    
      “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
      sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
      jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but
      slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
      immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on
      us all!”
     
    
      To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
      the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from
      the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but
      in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God’s burning
      finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin”
       has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
    
    
      While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
      enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
      their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
      constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic
      jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the
      black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego
      revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had
      been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light,
      Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.
    
    
      The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the
      Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two
      passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was
      Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same
      in the song.”
     
    
      “No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope
      they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have
      they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too
      dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
      of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
      chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will work
      up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as
      three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”
     
    
      At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning to
      glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once more
      the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
      supernaturalness in their pallor.
    
    
      “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.
    
    
      At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the
      Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away from
      him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they
      had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by
      the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed
      wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like
      the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others
      remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.
    
    
      “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame
      but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there;
      I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against
      fire! So.”
     
    
      Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
      foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
      he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
    
    
      “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once
      did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this
      hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know
      that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt
      thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed.
      No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power;
      but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional,
      unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a
      personality stands here. Though but a point at best; whencesoe’er I came;
      wheresoe’er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives
      in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come
      in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
      highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of
      full-freighted worlds, there’s that in here that still remains
      indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a
      true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.”
     
    
      [Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to
      thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his
      right hand pressed hard upon them.]
    
    
      “I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
      from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then
      grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of
      these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning
      flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten
      brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet
      blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out
      of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!
      The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh,
      thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my
      fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done
      with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how
      came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
      beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou
      knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing
      thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but
      time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my
      scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit
      immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated
      grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and
      lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded
      with thee; defyingly I worship thee!”
     
    
      “The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
     
    
      Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed in
      its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s bow;
      but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath
      to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame
      of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s
      tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is against thee,
      old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me
      square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it
      homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
     
    
      Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though
      not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts
      seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling
      lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved
      it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor
      that but cast loose a rope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more
      shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay,
      and Ahab again spoke:—
    
    
      “All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart,
      soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to
      what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!”
       And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.
    
    
      As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
      some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so
      much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so
      at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did run from him in a
      terror of dismay.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 120. The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.
    
    
      Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.
     
    
      “We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose
      and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”
     
    
      “Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up now.”
     
    
      “Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”
     
    
      “Well.”
     
    
      “The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”
     
    
      “Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
      but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By
      masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting
      smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were
      made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the
      cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their
      brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e’en
      take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh,
      take medicine, take medicine!”

      Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over the
      anchors there hanging.
    
    
      “No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you
      will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago
      is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say that whatever
      ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance
      policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of
      lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn’t you say so?”
     
    
      “Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
      time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder
      barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
      afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
      red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re Aquarius,
      or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don’t
      you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies
      have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I’ll
      answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the
      anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What’s the mighty
      difference between holding a mast’s lightning-rod in the storm, and
      standing close by a mast that hasn’t got any lightning-rod at all in a
      storm? Don’t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder
      of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about,
      then? Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man,
      and all of us,—were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than
      all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you
      King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about
      with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a
      militia officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
      don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye, then?
      any man with half an eye can be sensible.”
     
    
      “I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
     
    
      “Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s a
      fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the turn
      there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as
      if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here,
      Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And what big generous
      hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold
      they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;
      if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer
      that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on
      deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts,
      will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
      long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails
      tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with
      cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more
      monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and
      drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard;
      Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
      This is a nasty night, lad.”

      CHAPTER 123. The Musket.
    
    
      During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
      jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its
      spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it—for
      they were slack—because some play to the tiller was indispensable.
    
    
      In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to
      the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses,
      at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod’s; at almost
      every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity
      with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone
      can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.
    
    
      Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
      strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and
      the other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
      main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to
      leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to
      the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
    
    
      The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
      storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the
      water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,
      East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
      given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
      steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship
      as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good
      sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze became
      fair!
    
    
      Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “Ho! the fair
      wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!” the crew singing for joy, that so promising
      an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.
    
    
      In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
      immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change
      in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards
      to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
      mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
    
    
      Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
      moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was
      burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted
      door,—a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper
      panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
      silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
      elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they
      stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,
      upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when he saw the
      muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its
      neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for
      itself.
    
    
      “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very musket
      that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me touch
      it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,
      strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and
      powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
      cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly while I think.—I
      come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,—that’s
      fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair for that accursed
      fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one; this one—I
      hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.—Aye
      and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike
      his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in
      these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of
      the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
      he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely
      suffered to drag a whole ship’s company down to doom with him?—Yes,
      it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship
      come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship
      will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant—put
      aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes,
      just there,—in there, he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive,
      and soon awake again. I can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not
      reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this
      thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou
      breathest. Aye, and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us
      are Ahabs. Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful
      way?—Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this
      old man’s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try
      it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
      chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous
      than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly
      fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would
      leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
      hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here
      upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and
      law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a murderer when its
      lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and
      skin together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and
      slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded
      musket’s end against the door.
    
    
      “On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch,
      and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh Mary!
      Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
      who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body this day week may
      sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall I?—The
      wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed
      and set; she heads her course.”
     
    
      “Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
     
    
      Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s
      tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream to
      speak.
    
    
      The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel;
      Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
      placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
    
    
      “He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
      him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
    
    
      Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
      mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
      like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,
      that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed
      before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was
      only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays
      moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and
      queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold,
      that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
    
    
      Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
      the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
      the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
      the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward place, and how the
      same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.
    
    
      “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
      the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
      Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
     
    
      But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
      helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
    
    
      “East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.
    
    
      “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this
      hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”
     
    
      Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed
      by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding
      palpableness must have been the cause.
    
    
      Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of
      the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed
      to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses
      pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
    
    
      But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old
      man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened before. Mr.
      Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s all. Thou
      hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
     
    
      “Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
      gloomily.
    
    
      Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
      one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
      developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
      the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at,
      that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually
      struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the
      effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its
      loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was
      of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle. But in either case, the
      needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
      lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all
      the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted
      into the kelson.
    
    
      Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
      compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the
      precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly
      inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be changed
      accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her
      undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only
      been juggling her.
    
    
      Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
      but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask—who
      in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise
      unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly
      rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
      ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or
      if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
      congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.
    
    
      For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing
      to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the
      quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
    
    
      “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,
      and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is
      lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without a
      pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles. Quick!”
     
    
      Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to
      do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
      revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
      matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man
      well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
      practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
      without some shudderings and evil portents.
    
    
      “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the
      things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s needles;
      but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point
      as true as any.”
     
    
      Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this
      was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
      follow. But Starbuck looked away.
    
    
      With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
      lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him
      hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after
      repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted
      needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several
      times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some
      small strange motions with it—whether indispensable to the
      magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the
      crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread; and moving to the
      binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
      suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At
      first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either
      end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently
      watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and
      pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,—“Look ye, for
      yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East,
      and that compass swears it!”
     
    
      One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
      persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.
    
    
      In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal
      pride.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
    
    
      While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
      and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
      upon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen, and
      many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;
      though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake than anything
      else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered
      by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every
      hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log
      attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after
      bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all
      the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But heedless
      of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
      not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant
      was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line.
      The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
    
    
      “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
     
    
      Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. “Take
      the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
     
    
      They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the
      deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the
      creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
    
    
      The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
      handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
      stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.
    
    
      Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
      turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
      Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
      speak.
    
    
      “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
      spoiled it.”
     
    
      “’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
      Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
     
    
      “I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs
      of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a superior, who’ll
      ne’er confess.”
     
    
      “What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
      granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
      thou born?”
     
    
      “In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”
     
    
      “Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”
     
    
      “I know not, sir, but I was born there.”
     
    
      “In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
      from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
      which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
      butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”
     
    
      The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
      dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
      turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
      resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
    
    
      “Hold hard!”
     
    
      Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging
      log was gone.
    
    
      “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea
      parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel
      up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend
      thou the line. See to it.”
     
    
      “There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer seems
      loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!
      These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging
      slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”
     
    
      “Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
      Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard;
      I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no
      cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a
      hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
      sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
     
    
      “Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. “Away
      from the quarter-deck!”
     
    
      “The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
      “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
    
    
      “Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”
     
    
      “And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
      thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
      through! Who art thou, boy?”
     
    
      “Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred
      pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks cowardly—quickest
      known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the coward?”
     
    
      “There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look
      down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye
      creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s home
      henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou
      art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s down.”
     
    
      “What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s hand,
      and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,
      perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
      something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and
      rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will
      not let this go.”
     
    
      “Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
      horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods
      all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
      oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what
      he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel
      prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
      Emperor’s!”
     
    
      “There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with
      strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the rotten
      line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new
      line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
    
    
      Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress
      solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
      path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
      unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
      by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed
      the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
    
    
      At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
      Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
      dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
      headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
      unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
      Herod’s murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their
      reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
      transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry
      remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said
      it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained
      unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of all—declared
      that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly
      drowned men in the sea.
    
    
      Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
      came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied
      with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the
      wonder.
    
    
      Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
      of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that
      had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with
      her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the
      more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very
      superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar
      tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads
      and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water
      alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than
      once been mistaken for men.
    
    
      But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
      confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise
      this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether
      it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors
      sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus with the
      man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long
      at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a rushing—and
      looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a
      little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.
    
    
      The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern,
      where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
      seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so
      that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every
      pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom,
      as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
    
    
      And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for
      the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man was
      swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.
      Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a
      portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the
      future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared
      that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the
      night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
    
    
      The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to
      it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the
      feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage,
      all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with
      its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going
      to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange
      signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.
    
    
      “A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.
    
    
      “Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.
    
    
      “It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can
      arrange it easily.”
     
    
      “Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a
      melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the
      coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”
     
    
      “And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.
    
    
      “Aye.”
     
    
      “And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a
      caulking-iron.
    
    
      “Aye.”
     
    
      “And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand as
      with a pitch-pot.
    
    
      “Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no
      more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”
     
    
      “He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.
      Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like
      a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won’t put his head
      into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I’m
      ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like turning an old coat; going to
      bring the flesh on the other side now. I don’t like this cobbling sort of
      business—I don’t like it at all; it’s undignified; it’s not my
      place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to
      take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,
      something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle
      when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job,
      that’s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It’s the
      old woman’s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all
      old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away
      with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would
      work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off
      with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.
      Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten
      them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship’s stern.
      Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old
      carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the
      job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered
      with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We
      workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins
      and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not
      for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too
      confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job,
      now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s see—how many in the ship’s
      company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me thirty
      separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round
      to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll be thirty lively
      fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath
      the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s
      to it.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 127. The Deck.
    
    
      The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open
      hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum
      slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.—Ahab
      comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.
    
    
      “Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
      complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of
      a church! What’s here?”
     
    
      “Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
      hatchway!”
     
    
      “Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”
     
    
      “Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”
     
    
      “Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?”
     
    
      “I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”
     
    
      “Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”
     
    
      “Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
      they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”
     
    
      “Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
      monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
      next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
      same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
      jack-of-all-trades.”
     
    
      “But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”
     
    
      “The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?
      The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for
      volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost
      thou never?”
     
    
      “Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the
      reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was
      none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to
      it.”
     
    
      “Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in all
      things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And
      yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
      Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the
      churchyard gate, going in?
    
    
      “Faith, sir, I’ve——”
     
    
      “Faith? What’s that?”
     
    
      “Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
      sir.”
     
    
      “Um, um; go on.”
     
    
      “I was about to say, sir, that——”
     
    
      “Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look
      at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”
     
    
      “He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
      latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos,
      is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of
      Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always under the
      Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum;
      quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the
      professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”
     
    
      (Ahab to himself.)
    
    
      “There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker
      tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
      thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that
      fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
      materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
      now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
      expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy
      of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense
      the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I’ll think of
      that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other
      side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will
      ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let
      me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk
      this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown
      conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
    
    
      Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
      upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
      the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
      broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
      fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the
      smitten hull.
    
    
      “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
      commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could
      hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.
    
    
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      “Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
     
    
      Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and
      would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
      himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending her side. A
      few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod’s main-chains,
      and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a
      Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.
    
    
      “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely
      advancing. “How was it?”
     
    
      It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
      three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
      had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were
      yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had
      suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,
      the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been instantly
      lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat—the
      swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in fastening—at
      least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it.
      In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam
      of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was
      concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his
      pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive
      alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness
      came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats—ere
      going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction—the
      ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till
      near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it. But
      the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail
      on stunsail—after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots
      for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when
      she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of
      the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare
      boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed
      on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued
      doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had
      been seen.
    
    
      The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
      object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own
      in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on
      parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
    
    
      “I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one in
      that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his watch—he’s
      so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships
      cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?
      See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of
      his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been the—”
     
    
      “My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I conjure”—here
      exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily
      received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship—I
      will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if there be no other
      way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you must,
      oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.”
     
    
      “His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the coat
      and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”
     
    
      “He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx sailor
      standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
     
    
      Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s the
      more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
      Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among the
      number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand,
      separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there
      had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was
      plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved
      for him by his chief mate’s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure
      of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between
      jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But
      the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
      mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he
      allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,
      whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s
      paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and
      wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor
      does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of
      such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ 
      voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of
      a whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
      father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
      concern.
    
    
      Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and
      Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the
      least quivering of his own.
    
    
      “I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say aye to me. Do to me as
      you would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have a boy,
      Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
      child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run,
      run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.”
     
    
      “Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
      prolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
      Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
      forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
      and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:
      then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”
     
    
      Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving
      the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection
      of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner
      silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and
      returned to his ship.
    
    
      Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
      was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
      however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
      starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head
      sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and
      yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when
      the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
    
    
      But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
      that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.
      She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.
    
    
      (Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)
    
    
      “Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming
      when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him.
      There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady.
      Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired
      health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou
      wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair;
      another screw to it, thou must be.”
     
    
      “No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for your
      one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part
      of ye.”
     
    
      “Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
      fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks
      like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”
     
    
      “They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
      drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
      But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
      ye.”
     
    
      “If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him. I
      tell thee no; it cannot be.”
     
    
      “Oh good master, master, master!
    
    
      “Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
      Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
      know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
      thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
      thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee, let what will
      befall.”
     
    
      (Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)
    
    
      “Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
      were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
      Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the door.
      What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening it. It
      must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed
      chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the transom, in the
      ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our
      old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit
      at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s
      this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the
      decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now,
      when a black boy’s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs,
      have ye seen one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog
      look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No!
      Well then, fill up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all
      cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table.
      Shame upon all cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh,
      master! master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here
      I’ll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and
      oysters come to join me.”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
    
    
      And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
      preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed
      to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
      there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
      where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been
      spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;—and
      now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly
      concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale
      tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there
      lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable
      for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which through the
      livelong, arctic, six months’ night sustains its piercing, steady, central
      gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant
      midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their
      bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls,
      and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.
    
    
      In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
      vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove
      to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
      finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab’s
      iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious
      that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
    
    
      But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he
      thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even
      as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance awed
      his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an
      added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such
      ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half
      uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or
      else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being’s body.
      And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had
      Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. He would stand
      still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
      plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.
    
    
      Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
      deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or
      exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
      main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
      cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to
      step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless
      he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
      in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
      tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
      times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though
      he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the
      unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat
      and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s sunshine dried
      upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more
      beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent
      for.
    
    
      He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast
      and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
      grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow
      idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though
      his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee’s
      mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never
      seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
      some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
      spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
      crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one
      word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest
      verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail,
      they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by
      the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
      Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned
      substance.
    
    
      And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
      and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
      seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
      seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade
      siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was
      solid Ahab.
    
    
      At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
      from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till
      after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the
      striking of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp!
      sharp!”
     
    
      But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
      children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
      old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly all
      except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and
      Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these
      suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
      expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
    
    
      “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye!
      Ahab must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
      basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block,
      to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
      downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
      the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end
      yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his
      crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo,
      Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm
      relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the rope, sir—I
      give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his person in the
      basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck
      being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.
      And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad
      upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead, astern, this side, and
      that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a
      height.
    
    
      When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the
      rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted
      up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
      circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
      to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a
      wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft
      cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck;
      and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast
      down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
      unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
      carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.
      So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange
      thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
      had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
      approaching to decision—one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
      look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;—it was strange, that this
      was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
      whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person’s hands.
    
    
      Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
      minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
      incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
      latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
      in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
      straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying
      again round his head.
    
    
      But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not
      to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it
      much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful
      eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.
    
    
      “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being
      posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat
      lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.
    
    
      But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long hooked
      bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his
      prize.
    
    
      An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace it,
      and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of
      Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.
      Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far
      in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of
      that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from
      that vast height into the sea.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
    
    
      The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
      life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
      misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed
      upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross
      the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the
      spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
    
    
      Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some
      few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw
      through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
      half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
    
    
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
     
    
      “Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his
      trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
    
    
      “Hast killed him?”
     
    
      “The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the
      other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
      sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
    
    
      “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
      held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I
      hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
      barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,
      where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”
     
    
      “Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
      hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
      yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest were
      buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning to his
      crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift
      the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with
      uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”
     
    
      “Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
    
    
      But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
      of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
      quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
      her hull with their ghostly baptism.
    
    
      As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
      hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.
    
    
      “Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake. “In
      vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
      taffrail to show us your coffin!”
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
    
    
      It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly
      separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
      transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and
      man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s chest
      in his sleep.
    
    
      Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
      unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but
      to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty
      leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled,
      murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
    
    
      But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
      shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
      that distinguished them.
    
    
      Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air
      to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling
      line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at
      the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms,
      with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
    
    
      Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and
      unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of
      ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting
      his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s forehead of heaven.
    
    
      Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
      creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
      oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
      little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
      their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the
      marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
    
    
      Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
      watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
      and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
      aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the
      cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did
      at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now
      threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously
      sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could
      yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched
      hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
      wealth as that one wee drop.
    
    
      Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
      and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
      stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him,
      or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.
    
    
      Ahab turned.
    
    
      “Starbuck!”
     
    
      “Sir.”
     
    
      “Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a
      day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
      boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago!
      Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
      storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
      forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of
      the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent
      three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of
      solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain’s
      exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
      green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery
      of solitary command!—when I think of all this; only half-suspected,
      not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty years I have fed
      upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!—when
      the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
      world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away, whole oceans away,
      from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
      the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—wife? wife?—rather
      a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I
      married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling
      blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab
      has furiously, foamingly chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye,
      aye! what a forty years’ fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab
      been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the
      oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?
      Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,
      one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old
      hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never
      grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old,
      Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam,
      staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack
      my heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting
      mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and
      feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look
      into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than
      to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
      the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
      stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
      gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
      the far away home I see in that eye!”
     
    
      “Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
      should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly
      these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck’s—wife
      and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine,
      sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!
      Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter the course! How
      cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see
      old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days,
      even as this, in Nantucket.”
     
    
      “They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the
      morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
      vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
      cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to
      dance him again.”
     
    
      “’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
      should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father’s
      sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
      Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy’s face
      from the window! the boy’s hand on the hill!”
     
    
      But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
      cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
    
    
      “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
      cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands
      me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and
      crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready
      to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare?
      Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great
      sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single
      star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small
      heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that
      beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man,
      we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and
      Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
      unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and
      fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the
      judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a
      mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away
      meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes,
      Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?
      Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye,
      and rust amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in
      the half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
     
    
      But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
    
    
      Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two
      reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
      leaning over the same rail.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.
    
    
      That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at
      intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
      went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
      up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
      barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar
      odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale,
      was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after
      inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the
      precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered
      the ship’s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
    
    
      The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at
      daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise
      ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles
      bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at
      the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
    
    
      “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”
     
    
      Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
      deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed
      to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their
      clothes in their hands.
    
    
      “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
    
    
      “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.
    
    
      “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
     
    
      All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying
      him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting
      him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while
      peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and
      top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air. “There she blows!—there
      she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!”
     
    
      Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
      look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
      whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch,
      some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on
      the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s head was almost on a
      level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile
      or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump,
      and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous
      mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in
      the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
    
    
      “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
      all around him.
    
    
      “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
      cried out,” said Tashtego.
    
    
      “Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
      reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the
      White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she
      blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn,
      lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
      whale’s visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
      top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on
      board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,
      steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats
      there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,—quick,
      quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.
    
    
      “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from
      us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”
     
    
      “Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
      Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
     
    
      Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails set—all
      the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
      heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a
      hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
    
    
      Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
      but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
      still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
      noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came
      so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was
      distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and
      continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He
      saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.
      Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening
      white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully
      accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed
      over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
      bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the
      light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate
      with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the
      painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance
      projected from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud
      of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
      the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers
      streaming like pennons.
    
    
      A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
      invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
      ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes
      sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling
      straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty
      Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.
    
    
      On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once
      leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale
      shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
      namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to
      assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
      tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who
      for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou
      may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
    
    
      And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
      waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick
      moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged
      trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the
      fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole
      marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s Natural Bridge, and
      warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed
      himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping
      on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool
      that he left.
    
    
      With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
      three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.
    
    
      “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
      beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
      vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
      whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now
      freshened; the sea began to swell.
    
    
      “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.
    
    
      In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
      all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
      fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
      expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could discover
      no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its
      depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
      weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till
      it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of
      white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It
      was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still
      half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned
      beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong
      sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this
      tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with
      him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his
      crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
    
    
      Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its
      bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet under
      water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious
      intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were,
      in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.
    
    
      Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an
      instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting
      shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that
      the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and
      one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the
      inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s head, and reached higher
      than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as
      a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and
      crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each
      other’s heads to gain the uttermost stern.
    
    
      And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
      whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
      body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the
      bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the
      other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to
      withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing
      vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very
      jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his
      naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus
      vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in,
      collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding
      further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast
      again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated
      aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to
      the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.
    
    
      At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to
      perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
      movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
      made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping
      further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped,
      the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he
      leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.
    
    
      Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
      distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
      billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so
      that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet
      out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent
      waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered
      spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled
      Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly
      to overleap its summit with their scud.
    
    
      *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation
      (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise
      of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously
      described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
      view whatever objects may be encircling him.
    
    
      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.
      The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of
      grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the book of
      Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale’s
      insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he could
      still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless
      Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
      might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and
      mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
      succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so
      revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s aspect, and so planetarily
      swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally
      swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered
      hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that
      should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized
      castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to
      escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the
      direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man’s head.
    
    
      Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s
      mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and
      was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on the”—but
      that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him
      for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a
      towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him
      off!”
     
    
      The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
      effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam
      off, the boats flew to the rescue.
    
    
      Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
      caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily strength did
      crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a time, lying all
      crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden under foot of
      herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate
      sounds from out ravines.
    
    
      But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
      abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to
      one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
      through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in
      each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
      aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities;
      for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the
      entire circumferences of inferior souls.
    
    
      “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one
      bended arm—“is it safe?”
     
    
      “Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.
    
    
      “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
     
    
      “One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here
      are five men.”
     
    
      “That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!
      there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands
      off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail;
      out oars; the helm!”
     
    
      It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up
      by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus
      continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the
      added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he
      seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which
      plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the
      chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor
      could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense
      straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
      vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the
      most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly,
      the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the
      two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her—and
      then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and
      sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings
      of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
      the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was
      regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
      reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
      deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted
      hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now? D’ye
      see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to
      lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and
      motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
    
    
      As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
      or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
      greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
      every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the
      quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At
      last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh
      troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man’s face
      there now stole some such added gloom as this.
    
    
      Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince
      his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his
      Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The
      thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
     
    
      “What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I
      not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear
      thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.”
     
    
      “Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen, and
      an ill one.”
     
    
      “Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
      man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give
      an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
      of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
      two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
      peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
      now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout
      ten times a second!”
     
    
      The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
      Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
    
    
      “Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from
      the air.
    
    
      “How heading when last seen?”
     
    
      “As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”
     
    
      “Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and top-gallant
      stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he’s
      making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full
      before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send a fresh
      hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.”—Then
      advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men, this gold is
      mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale
      is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall
      be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on that day I shall again raise
      him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!—the
      deck is thine, sir!”
     
    
      And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
      slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing
      himself to see how the night wore on.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.
    
    
      At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
    
    
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to
      spread.
    
    
      “See nothing, sir.”
     
    
      “Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;—the
      top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all night.
      But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”
     
    
      Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
      continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
      by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,
      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the
      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a
      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly
      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,
      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through
      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the
      creature’s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to
      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that
      to this hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing
      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as
      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,
      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence
      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this
      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at
      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman’s
      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is
      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a
      quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many
      collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.
    
    
      The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,
      missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.
    
    
      “By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck creeps
      up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave
      fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on
      the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
      that leaves no dust behind!”
     
    
      “There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was
      now the mast-head cry.
    
    
      “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on
      and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
      your trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood,
      as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!”
     
    
      And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of
      the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked
      anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt
      before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe
      of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid
      prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had
      snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day;
      the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind,
      reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying
      mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that
      made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms
      invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency
      which so enslaved them to the race.
    
    
      They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
      though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
      and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each
      other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
      directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the
      crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all
      varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
      goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
    
    
      The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
      outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
      hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading
      their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all
      the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!
      how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing
      that might destroy them!
    
    
      “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after the
      lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. “Sway
      me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that
      way, and then disappears.”
     
    
      It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
      other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
      hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin
      on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air
      vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo
      of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship than
      the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick
      bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by
      the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
      Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of
      breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the
      Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and
      piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of
      seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
      off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.
    
    
      “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his
      immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
      Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
      against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
      the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood
      there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,
      to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
    
    
      “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour and
      thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
      fore. The boats!—stand by!”
     
    
      Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
      shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards;
      while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.
    
    
      “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare
      one, rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep
      away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”
     
    
      As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
      assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three
      crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he
      would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up to his
      forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
      such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong vision.
      But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
      plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
      himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among
      the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on
      every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
      seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those
      boats were made. But skilfully manÅuvred, incessantly wheeling like
      trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,
      at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the time, Ahab’s unearthly
      slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
    
    
      But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and
      recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines
      now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the
      devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment
      the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous
      charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then
      was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping that way to
      disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
      than the embattled teeth of sharks!
    
    
      Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
      harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
      flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only
      one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
      within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel;
      dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,
      twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted
      fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
      White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
      lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb
      and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks
      on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
      a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the
      wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred
      bowl of punch.
    
    
      While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
      the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope
      little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs
      upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
      singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man’s line—now
      parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom
      he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted
      perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by
      invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the
      sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and
      sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again—gunwale
      downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like
      seals from a sea-side cave.
    
    
      The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as
      he struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a
      little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with
      his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes
      from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
      or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
      came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for
      that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and
      trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a
      traveller’s methodic pace.
    
    
      As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came
      bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating
      mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely
      landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;
      livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies
      of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or
      even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day
      before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat’s broken half,
      which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as
      the previous day’s mishap.
    
    
      But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
      instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
      Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg
      had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
    
    
      “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
      will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
     
    
      “The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
      put good work into that leg.”
     
    
      “But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.
    
    
      “Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But
      even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
      bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white
      whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper
      and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
      yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”
     
    
      “Dead to leeward, sir.”
     
    
      “Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the
      spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s
      crews.”
     
    
      “Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”
     
    
      “Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
      unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
     
    
      “Sir?”
     
    
      “My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
      shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By
      heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
     
    
      The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
      Parsee was not there.
    
    
      “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
     
    
      “The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
      forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
     
    
      But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
      nowhere to be found.
    
    
      “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I
      thought I saw him dragging under.”
     
    
      “My line! my line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
      death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
      The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the
      forged iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered
      fool! this hand did dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there!
      Keep him nailed—Quick!—all hands to the rigging of the boats—collect
      the oars—harpooneers! the irons, the irons!—hoist the royals
      higher—a pull on all the sheets!—helm there! steady, steady
      for your life! I’ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive
      straight through it, but I’ll slay him yet!”
     
    
      “Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
      “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more
      of this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
      to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
      shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
      wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps
      the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be
      towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety and blasphemy to hunt
      him more!”
     
    
      “Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour
      we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
      matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
      hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
      whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
      years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
      under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand
      round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a
      shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s
      part; but Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I
      feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
      gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till ye
      hear that, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men,
      in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they
      drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
      sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s floated—tomorrow
      will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but only to spout
      his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
     
    
      “As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.
    
    
      “And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
      muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to
      Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to
      drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
      Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but
      still was to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s
      a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the
      whole line of judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. I’ll,
      I’ll solve it, though!”
     
    
      When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
    
    
      So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
      the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
      grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
      in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
      their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab’s
      wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the
      night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid,
      heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
      eastward for the earliest sun.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.
    
    
      The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
      solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
      daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
    
    
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
    
    
      “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm
      there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer
      day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time
      to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that’s
      tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only has that
      right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
      calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
      that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen
      calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned
      to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment
      growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common
      grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice
      or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as
      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile
      wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,
      and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither
      as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind,
      I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to
      a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!
      who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.
      Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even
      Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind
      but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal
      man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as
      agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious
      difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there’s something
      all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least,
      that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,
      vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser
      currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the
      land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the
      eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;
      these Trades, or something like them—something so unchangeable, and
      full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d’ye
      see?”
     
    
      “Nothing, sir.”
     
    
      “Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye,
      aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he’s
      chasing me now; not I, him—that’s bad; I might have known it, too.
      Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
      by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
      outs! Man the braces!”
     
    
      Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
      quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
      ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
      white wake.
    
    
      “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
      himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God keep
      us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my
      flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
     
    
      “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. “We
      should meet him soon.”
     
    
      “Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once
      more Ahab swung on high.
    
    
      A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
      long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
      weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
      mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.
    
    
      “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
      there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far
      off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman
      with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have
      one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s time for that. An
      old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink
      since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!—the
      same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a soft shower to leeward.
      Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere—to something else
      than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes
      that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But
      good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny
      mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab’s
      head! There’s the difference now between man’s old age and matter’s. But
      aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are
      we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood
      has the better of my live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and
      I’ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of
      the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should
      still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I
      have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless
      stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.
      Aye, aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
      Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep
      a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow, nay,
      to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.”
     
    
      He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through
      the cloven blue air to the deck.
    
    
      In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s
      stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
      mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him
      pause.
    
    
      “Starbuck!”
     
    
      “Sir?”
     
    
      “For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
     
    
      “Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”
     
    
      “Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
      Starbuck!”
     
    
      “Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
     
    
      “Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
      flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,
      Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”
     
    
      Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.
    
    
      “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see,
      it’s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
     
    
      “Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by
      the crew!”
     
    
      In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
    
    
      “The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
      “O master, my master, come back!”
     
    
      But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
      boat leaped on.
    
    
      Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
      numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the
      hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
      dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
      bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those
      swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same
      prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments
      in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the
      Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was
      that Ahab’s crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore
      their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a matter
      sometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they seemed to
      follow that one boat without molesting the others.
    
    
      “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
      following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring
      boldly to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
      followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third
      day?—For when three days flow together in one continuous intense
      pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the
      third the evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may.
      Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly
      calm, yet expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things
      swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is
      somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!
      I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life
      seem clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming?
      My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
      it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak
      aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
      there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the
      whale!—Ho! again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears
      the vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the
      main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with it!—Where’s the old man
      now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder, shudder!”
     
    
      The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
      downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending
      to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways
      from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence,
      as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.
    
    
      “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive
      them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse
      can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”
     
    
      Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
      quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
      swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
      subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
      trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but
      obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
      hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back
      into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an
      instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,
      leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk
      of the whale.
    
    
      “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the
      attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby
      Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.
      The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead,
      beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came
      churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart;
      spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates’ boats, and dashing
      in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab’s almost
      without a scar.
    
    
      While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
      whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
      shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and
      round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
      during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
      around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
      frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.
    
    
      The harpoon dropped from his hand.
    
    
      “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye,
      Parsee! I see thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this
      then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last
      letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship!
      those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to
      me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that
      but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
      not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the
      whale? gone down again?”
     
    
      But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
      corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
      been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
      swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus far had
      been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her
      headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and
      now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.
    
    
      “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third day,
      to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly
      seekest him!”
     
    
      Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
      leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the
      vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he leaned
      over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not
      too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego,
      Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the
      oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been
      hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing them. One after
      the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying
      glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of
      new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the
      broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But
      he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
      main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to
      descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to
      the mast.
    
    
      Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to his
      swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent
      deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale’s way
      now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him
      once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not been so long a one
      as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks
      accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so
      continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and
      crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.
    
    
      “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!
      ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”
     
    
      “But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
     
    
      “They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
      muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
      Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm!
      take the helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
      him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.
    
    
      At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
      the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance—as
      the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky
      mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled round his
      great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body
      arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted
      his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both
      steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick
      sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow,
      and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that
      had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then
      clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was,
      three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the
      dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects—these were flung
      out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale
      again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
      inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat
      and swimming.
    
    
      Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
      instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea.
      But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line,
      and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and
      tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that
      double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
    
    
      “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
      Burst in upon him!”
     
    
      Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
      round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
      catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in
      it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
      larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow,
      smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
    
    
      Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands! stretch
      out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”
     
    
      “The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.
    
    
      “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever
      too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the
      ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
     
    
      But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
      sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
      burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay
      nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard
      to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
    
    
      Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
      remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
      with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
      forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
      bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as
      he.
    
    
      “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
      now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman’s
      fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the
      end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab,
      Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He
      turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose
      duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!”
     
    
      “Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
      Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
      Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own unwinking eye?
      And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would
      it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look
      ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever
      spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye,
      would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but
      there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off
      shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and
      over salted death, though;—cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask,
      for one red cherry ere we die!”
     
    
      “Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my
      poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now
      come to her, for the voyage is up.”
     
    
      From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
      bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands,
      just as they had darted from their various employments; all their
      enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
      vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading
      semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,
      eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man
      could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s
      starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
      faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on
      their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as
      mountain torrents down a flume.
    
    
      “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;
      “its wood could only be American!”
     
    
      Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel;
      but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the
      other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a time, he
      lay quiescent.
    
    
      “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.
      Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only
      god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious
      ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond
      pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life!
      Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from
      all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
      foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I
      roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple
      with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my
      last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
      and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
      chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the
      spear!”
     
    
      The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
      velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
      clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck,
      and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out
      of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy
      eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub,
      knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.
    
    
      For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
      ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering
      mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana;
      only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or
      fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
      still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric
      circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
      oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round
      and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of
      sight.
    
    
      But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken
      head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar
      yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly
      undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they
      almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered
      backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster
      and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had
      followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among the stars,
      pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced
      to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood;
      and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage
      beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird
      of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards,
      and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his
      ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a
      living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
    
    
      Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
      surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
      shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Epilogue
    
    
      “AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.
    
    
      The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
      did survive the wreck.
    
    
      It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the
      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,
      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a
      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like
      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black
      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin
      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on
      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It
      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her
      missing children, only found another orphan.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
